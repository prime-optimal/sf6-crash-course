# The Drive System and OD Moves in Street Fighter 6

## Drive System Overview

The drive system is one of the biggest changes in Street Fighter 6 compared to Street Fighter 5. The drive system allows for all kinds of defensive and offensive options, and it's the resource system that you'll be using most frequently in the game. It's represented by the drive gauge, which you can see underneath the life bar. Both players start each round with a full drive gauge.

## Impact on Gameplay Dynamics

Because you start each round with a full drive gauge, all the different options the drive gauge gives you access to are available immediately at the beginning of each round. This changes the dynamic of the opening round compared to previous Street Fighter games. In Street Fighter IV, V, and III: Third Strike, you start with zero resources and build them up as the round progresses.

For example, in Street Fighter 5, special moves can be upgraded to EX special moves by spending one of your four available EX stocks. EX special moves typically have special properties. Ryu's EX fireball, for instance, hits twice instead of once and knocks down. His EX Donkey Kick gains the wall bounce property, which means you can juggle afterwards. EXDPs, like Ken and Ryu, gain invincibility, extra damage, and additional hits. But at the beginning of the round, none of this is available.

In Street Fighter 6, EX moves have been replaced by OD moves, which work the same way, except they cost two stocks of drive gauge. So one third of your bar, and you start each round with all six stocks. In Street Fighter V, your EX stocks carry over from round to round, but in Street Fighter 6, you start each round with all six. In Street Fighter 5, your V gauge would reset every round, incentivizing you to use your V trigger, V reversal, or V dash since it's going to reset at the end of the round anyway.

The last Street Fighter game that started you off with all your offensive resources was the Alpha series, and the Marvel vs. Capcom series also starts you with one super meter.

If you played any of those games, that should give you a better idea of how starting with resources affects the beginning of each round.

## Encouraging Faster Openings
In Street Fighter 6, not only are you incentivized to use your drive gauge every round, but you also have the option to use any drive gauge options from the very beginning of the round. 

This encourages a faster opening of each round because, in addition to the OD moves that are immediately accessible, there are also drive rush cancels and parry drive rush. We'll get into those next.
