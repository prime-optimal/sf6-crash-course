# Drive Rush Cancel in Street Fighter 6

## Understanding Drive Rush

Drive rush is performed by inputting a dash during a normal that is special cancelable. It costs three drive gauge stocks, which means you can only do a maximum of two before you run out of meter. Drive rush allows you to cancel a normal into another normal. When the drive rush is executed, the animation carries you forward quite a long way. In addition, when you drive rush, the normal you cancel gains +4 on hit and on block.

## A Basic Example with Ryu

Ryu can drive rush cancel his cr. MK. If it hits, he is +11. Without canceling into drive rush, cr. MK is only +1 on hit. So by canceling into drive rush, you get an extra 10 frames of advantage. Since he's now +11 after the drive rush cancel, it opens up new combo opportunities that wouldn't be possible otherwise, such as comboing into st. HP, which has a 10-frame startup and is normally +3 on hit.

Off of a normal st. HP, you wouldn't be able to link into another normal because it's only +3 on hit. It is cancelable, so you could cancel into any of his special moves, like his fireball or his DP. In this situation, the frame data of the original cr. MK changes after the drive rush cancel, and st. HP also benefits from it. After the cr. MK drive rush cancel, st. HP goes from being +3 on hit to being +7 on hit after the drive rush.

## Extending Combos with Drive Rush Cancel

Now that the st. HP is +7 on hit after the drive rush, you can link it into another normal with a startup of seven frames or less. Ryu only has one grounded seven-frame normal: his B+HP, which does 800 damage, forces a stand on hit, and is cancelable into a special move or any of his supers. Since it's special cancelable, you can also cancel into another drive rush, costing three more drive gauge stocks.

The cr. MK drive rush into st. HP, which links into B+HP, can be canceled into a heavy donkey kick, resulting in a total damage of 2179. The two extra hits you're able to score make a significant difference. Without doing the drive rush cancel, you would be limited to cr. MK into a medium donkey kick, which does 1380 damage. So, through the use of drive rush cancel at the cost of three drive gauge stocks, you increase the damage from 1380 to 2179 in this basic example.
