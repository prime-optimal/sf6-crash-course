## Objective
The primary goal in Street Fighter 6 is to deplete your opponent's health to zero. The first player to achieve this wins the round. Each game consists of two out of three rounds, and typically, matches are considered two out of three games. This setup is consistent in both ranked matches and tournament matches.

## Movement

There are three main ways to move in Street Fighter 6: walking, dashing, and jumping. Each method of movement comes with its own advantages and disadvantages.

- **Walking:** The safest but slowest form of movement. You can instantly block low or high by pressing down-back or back while walking.

- **Dashing:** Achieved by quickly tapping forward twice (for forward dash) or backward twice (for backward dash). Dashing is faster than walking, but leaves you vulnerable as the dash animation cannot be stopped once initiated.

- **Jumping:** There are three types of jumps - neutral jump (straight up and down), forward jump, and backward jump. When jumping, any normal move can be performed, and some characters even have special moves that can be done in mid-air. However, you cannot block while in the air, making jumping a risky move against a competent player who can perform anti-air attacks effectively.

## Cross-ups

When jumping, most characters have an attack button they can use as a "cross-up." This is when the attacker jumps over the defender and lands an attack on the other side, which must be blocked in the opposite direction. 

Jumping attacks, or "jump-ins," and cross-ups can potentially deal more damage than ground combos as they can start with an extra hit coming down from the jump. Additionally, they can put you closer to your opponent, potentially allowing for combos that wouldn't be possible otherwise. For instance, after a cross-up Medium Kick performed "deep enough" (from shoulder to waist level), Ryu's standing Medium Punch can link into his back Heavy Punch.

Despite their potential for higher damage, jumps carry risk. Predictable jumps can easily be punished by experienced players, so timing and strategy are critical when deciding to leave the ground.

## Attacks and Controls
Street Fighter 6 provides six basic attack buttons: Light Punch, Medium Punch, Heavy Punch, Light Kick, Medium Kick, and Heavy Kick. There are three primary types of attacks:

1. **Normals:** Executed using any of the six attack buttons.
2. **Throws:** Performed by pressing Light Punch and Light Kick in Classic Controls, or Light and Medium in Modern Controls. Throws are unblockable and effective against defensive opponents, especially those cornered.
3. **Projectiles:** Character-specific ranged attacks like Ryu's Fireball or Guile's Sonic Boom, useful for zoning or keeping opponents at a distance.

## Blocking and Defense
Blocking in Street Fighter 6 depends on the type of attack. Each attack can be a high, a mid, or a low.

- **High Attacks:** Must be blocked high by holding back.
- **Mid Attacks:** Can be blocked high or low (holding back or down back).
- **Low Attacks:** Must be blocked low (holding down back).

To neutralize throws, you need to input the throw command at the same time you anticipate a throw from your opponent. Keep in mind, if you're too far away, the throw will whiff, leaving you in a vulnerable state for a counter-attack, which inflicts 20% extra damage.

## Normals

Each character in Street Fighter 6 has six basic attack buttons: Light, Medium, and Heavy Punch, and Light, Medium, and Heavy Kick. These moves can be performed in three different states: standing, crouching, or jumping. This means that each character has 18 basic normals in total.

Beyond these, characters also possess "command normals," executed by pressing a direction along with an attack button. For instance, Ryu's overhead attack (which has to be blocked high) is performed by pressing forward and Medium Punch. His Heavy Kick is a two-hit move that is cancellable, and can be used to extend an OverDrive (OD) Donkey Kick combo after a wall bounce by cancelling the Back Heavy Kick (Axe Kick) into his Dragon Punch (DP).

## Throws

Throws are executed by pressing LP + LK at the same time. Throws cannot be blocked. However, they can be neutralized or “teched,“ by pressing LP + LK when you anticipate a throw.  This window is pretty small, so it’s more of a guess than a reaction.  

Normal attacks or special attacks that collide with the throw will beat it, provided the attack was extended before the throw is initiated. 

Throws have limited range, and if you miss one because you're too far away or your opponent is in block stun, you are vulnerable to a counter-attack. This hit will count as a punish counter, leading to increased damage and frame advantage.

There are also command throws (or command grabs), which are unblockable like regular throws but generally inflict more damage. Command throws require specific inputs, such as a half-circle back or a 270-degree motion from forward to up. The most notable example of a command throw is Zangief's Spinning Pile Driver. As of the beta, the only character with a command grab is Jamie, so specifics about these moves in Street Fighter 6 remain largely unknown. However, in previous Street Fighter games, EX command grabs sometimes had armor.

## Drive Parry

Drive Parry is executed by pressing Medium Punch and Medium Kick together right before your opponent's attack makes contact. 

A successful parry negates any damage and each hit parried builds your Drive Gauge. 

Unlike in Street Fighter Third Strike, where parrying an attack allowed for a counter-attack before the opponent could block, parrying in Street Fighter 6 doesn't change the move's frame data. 

This means your ability to punish the opponent depends on which of their moves you parried and what you're attempting to counter with. 

## Drive Impact

Drive Impact is performed by pressing Heavy Punch and Heavy Kick simultaneously. If you're familiar with Street Fighter IV, this move is similar to the Focus Attack, but with two hits of armor instead of one. This means it takes three hits to break its armor, often making the best counter to a Drive Impact another Drive Impact. Understanding and effectively using Drive Impact is what separates a beginner from a more skilled player, particularly at lower levels. While initially it might be challenging to handle Drive Impact, with practice, you should be able to react to it efficiently. We will delve deeper into Drive Impact in a later chapter.

## Special Moves and Projectiles
Projectiles can be blocked, parried, and in certain cases, are punishable due to slow recovery. You have to be cautious when using projectiles as a well-timed jump from the opponent can lead to a massive damage combo.

Characters have a few anti-air tools, which are either normals or special moves, designed to intercept opponents attempting to attack from the air or upon your character's wakeup.

## Wakeup and Knockdowns
In case of knockdowns, there are two ways to get up:

1. **Quick Rise:** By not inputting anything, the character gets up in place.
2. **Back Roll:** By pressing any two buttons as you hit the ground, the character gets up and rolls back, increasing the distance between you and the opponent.

Both wakeups take the same number of frames, thus the timing is identical. The back roll's main advantage is that it reduces immediate danger but also risks pushing you further into the corner.

## Corner Strategy
The corner of the stage is typically the most dangerous area. Your options are limited, and an attempt to escape could result in heavy damage from an opponent's anti-air attack.

In Street Fighter 6, being cornered is even more perilous. If you're pushed back into the corner while blocking a Drive Impact, even a minor touch against the wall results in a crumple, allowing the attacker to follow up with a combo. This threat is heightened if your Drive Gauge is depleted (Burnout state), as a Drive Impact will cause a dizzy, providing the attacker with ample time to execute a high-damage combo.

## Special Moves

In addition to the six basic attack buttons, each character in Street Fighter 6 also has unique special moves. These are executed by performing a specific motion followed by an attack button. For instance, Ryu's Fireball is performed by inputting down, down-forward, forward and punch, or quarter circle forward punch. However, mastering these inputs can be challenging and may require building muscle memory.

In Street Fighter 6, an alternative control scheme has been introduced: the Modern control scheme. Instead of requiring specific motions, controls are simplified and only require pressing the special (SP) button to execute special moves.

Special moves can be powered up into OverDrive (OD) moves, or as they were known in previous games, EX moves. This enhancement uses two of the six Drive Gauge stocks and imbues the special move with special properties. For example, an OD-enhanced Ryu's Fireball inflicts more damage and knocks down the opponent upon impact.

## Super Combos

Supers, or Super Combos, are high-damage moves that consume one to three super meters located at the bottom left of the screen. Unlike health and the Drive Gauge, the Super Meter carries over from one round to the next.

Each character has Level 1, 2, and 3 Supers, consuming one, two, or three super bars respectively. When a player's health drops to 20% or less and they have three super bars, their Level 3 Super becomes a Critical Art (CA), dealing an additional 20% damage. Level 1 Supers have strike and throw invulnerability, but lack projectile invincibility.

## Combos

Combos are sequences of attacks that connect before the opponent can block. The game signals successful combos with a pop-up on the left side of the screen.

There are different types of combos:

1. **Cancels:** Many normal moves can be cancelled into special moves and Supers, interrupting the normal move's animation.

2. **Links:** This is where the hit stun of one move lasts long enough for the next move to connect before the opponent can block. This differs from cancels as the first move's animation completes before the next move.

3. **Chains:** Chain combos typically involve light buttons and one light attack is cancelled into another.

4. **Target Combos:** These are chain combos that don't necessarily start with light attacks. Their usefulness varies from character to character.

For instance, Ryu can perform a combo by chaining a crouching Light Kick to his crouching Light Punch. He can also link standing Medium Punches and cancel the second one into a Tatsu. His target combo could be standing Heavy Punch, standing Heavy Kick.

Despite not typically causing a lot of damage, chain combos can be practical as they can start from a crouching low attack, which the opponent would have to block low. On the other hand, because chain combos typically end in a special move, they can lead to significant damage if the special move is cancelled into a Super.
