## Drive Impact: The Defensive Offense Tool or The Offensive Defense Tool
We talked about how Drive Rush Cancel and Parry Drive Rush are two of the three offensive systems of the Drive System as a whole. Now, let's discuss Drive Impact, which can be used offensively and defensively.

Imagine the Drive System as a pentagon with offensive options on the left and defensive options on the right. Square in the middle is the Drive Impact, because it can be used both offensively and defensively.

To perform Drive Impact, press Heavy Punch (HP) and Heavy Kick (HK) together, and your character will lunge forward with a mid-range, mid-level attack that also comes with ***two hits of armor***! 

Each character’s Drive Impact has a startup of 26 frames with 2 active frames, which might seem long, but is just under half a second.  The total frames of each character’s DI is 62 frames, so it’s 35 frames of recovery makes it a high-risk, high-reward momentum shifter. 

> [!note]
> If you've played Street Fighter 4, you might notice similarities between Drive Impact and Focus Attack, particularly the armor and the crumple state you get from hitting Level 2 or Level 3 Focus Attack.

However, in Street Fighter 6, there's only one level of Drive Impact, and you can't hold it to delay when it comes out. 

Inputting the Drive Impact costs one of your Drive Gauge stocks, so you can’t throw it out recklessly and have to be aware of your screen position and meter.  

However, since you can absorb two hits due to its armor, you can DI pre-emptively against projectiles and other incoming mid-range moves.  

If you score a clean hit, the opponent is knocked back in an airborne state and gets pushed about half-screen towards the corner.  They also lose one of their Drive Gauge stocks.  It seems like the average DI does 800 damage, though Jamie and Kimberly only do 720.  

If you absorb a hit and score a Counterhit, you get a 20% damage boost, so a standard 800 damage DI gets bumped up to 960 damage and still scores a knockdown.  The opponent loses 1.25 Drive Gauge stocks. 

If you score a Punish Counter, you get a big crumple that gives you plenty of time to land a high-damage combo, in addition to the 20% damage bonus from the DI itself.  The opponent loses 1.5 Drive Gauge stocks in this instance.  

If it’s blocked, the opponent is pushed back towards the corner in a blowback/stagger state, leaving you at -3F, which isn’t punishable, but does reset the situation.  The opponent only loses 1/2 of a Drive Gauge stock if your DI is blocked. 

However, if Drive Impact connects while the opponent is near the corner, the pushback causes the opponent to hit the wall which triggers a Wall Splat state and you have an opportunity to convert into a combo.  The opponent still only loses 1/2 of a Drive Gauge stock, but the extra damage opportunity makes up for it.

> [!tip] Even if they barely touch the wall, you'll still get the Wall Splat, so be on the lookout for DI opportunities when the opponent is about 1/4 of the screen from the corner.

You can also cancel normals into Drive Impact. In the corner, this can be particularly effective, as it almost always guarantees a dizzy against opponents who are already in Burnout.

The dizzy gives you plenty of time to unload with your highest damaging combo, so be ready to capitalize on this massive opportunity!  

> [!tip] After the dizzy, the opponent immediately regains all six of their Drive Gauge stocks, so remember to keep an eye on your Drive Gauge or they might quickly return the favor!

## Countering Drive Impact
There are several ways to counter Drive Impact, but it’s worth noting that in the heat of battle, especially online or on a laggy setup, this can be easier said than done.  

1.  Use a Drive Impact of your own to absorb their hit and counter with a full crumple Punish Counter with the 20% damage boost. There's no tricky timing involved; if you see it coming, throw yours out, and whichever one comes out last wins. If they hit on the exact same frame, both characters are pushed back significantly, but this is rare.  Also, if you counter the opponent’s DI with your own, they lose 2.5 stocks total (1 for the attempt, 1.5 for getting Punish Countered).
2.  Throw the opponent out of Drive Impact during its startup frames, which scores a Counterhit and 20% damage bonus, so typically 1,200 damage total.  You have to be right next to the opponent and either had godlike reactions or have anticipated they were going for the DI.  This means DI generally can't be used effectively wakeup, even with its armor. However, if the active frames are already out and you go for the throw, you'll just get Counterhit and crumpled for your troubles.
3.  Neutral jump and bait Drive Impact, then use a heavy button into a combo to Punish Counter it.  This is most effective when you’re between 1/4 and 1/2 screen away from the opponent.  Your neutral jump has to be somewhat pre-emptive, as if you try and do it on reaction, you’ll likely get hit as you’re leaving the ground.  
4.  Use a move with armor-breaking properties (e.g., Guile's Level 1 Sonic Hurricane). Not all characters may have such a move, and typical reversals like Dragon Punches (DPs) or Guile's Flash Kick won't break armor, though powered-up multihit specials like an OD Flash Kick or OD Sonic Boom will do the trick if you cancel a normal like cr. MP first (remember, the DI has two hits of armor). 
5. Connect with three hits in quick succession before the DI makes contact with you.  This seems to be the most difficult option and generally impractical in most situations.  There may be characters that are able to land three-hit combos without spending Drive Gauge on an OD Special, but it’s too early to tell.

Although Drive Impact is not a huge threat in neutral situations unless it scores a Punish Counter, it's far more dangerous when used near or in the corner, especially when the opponent is low on Drive Gauge or already in Burnout. 


>[!hint] Remember, a player in Burnout no longer has access to their own DI, OD Moves, or parries, making it easier to make contact with your DI, especially when they're cornered.

It’s too early to tell exactly how effective DI will be over the longrun against strong players, but it’s likely to be extremely effective against most players early on in the game’s life cycle.  Its relatively low cost of a single Drive Gauge stock puts it at the same meter cost as a Parry Drive Rush.  

However, if your DI is countered with another DI, not only are you going to eat a big damage combo, you’ll also lose 2.5 bars, almost half of a fully stocked 6-bar Drive Gauge!

This high-risk, high-reward mechanic adds another layer of depth to corner mindgames, as it becomes a game of “chicken” with the defender needing to simultaneously watch out for the DI, while trying to fight their way out of the corner.  

Overzealous attackers may become predictable when going for the DI against a cornered opponent.  But even if your back is against the wall, with a sliver of Drive Gauge left, it’s still possible to counter a DI on reaction if you can maintain your cool.
