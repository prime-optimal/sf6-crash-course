### Raw Transcript 
```text
We talked about how Drive Rush Cancel and parry Drive Rush are the two of the two of Well, and OT Boogs are the two, or I guess the three, like the three offensive, of the three offensive systems of the drives of the Drive System as a whole.

So before we talk about the two defensive Drive Systems, it's a good time to talk about impact which can be used offensively and defensively.

So, like if you think of Imagine the Drive System as a pentagon with offensive on one side, offensive on the left, and defensive options on the right.

square in the middle is the Drive Impact.

And that's because it could be used offensively defensively, as well as defensively.

Because it has -- ah.

Because it has two hits of armor.

Sorry, I think it has three hits of armor.

3 hits of armor.

Okay, I have to check.

Either way, the way it works is you press heavy punch and Heavy Kick together and the character you know like lunges forward with a like a mid-range mid-level attack if you played Street Fighter 4 then you might.

.

.

you can see the similarities between Drive Impact and focus attack.

And this is because of the armor that it has, as well as the crumple state that you get from hitting Level 2 or Level 3 Focus Attack.

In this game, there's only one level of Drive Impact so you can't hold it to delay when it comes out.

Oh.

So you can't delay it.

Umm.

.

.

but if you hit it or if it hits, it umm.

.

.

But if it hits, you get the crumple.

So It also costs one of your Drive Gauge stocks.

So you can, which puts it at the same cost as doing a parry Drive Rush.

[silence] So, if it connects, then.

.

.

Okay, if it hits, then you get a really big crumple which lasts a lot of time.

And if it's blocked, then the opponent is like they enter like a kind of a stagger step almost where they're pushed back towards the corner.

You may or may not have frame advantage, the frame advantage is probably negated by how far back the opponent is pushed.

However, if the Drive Impact is done close enough to the corner where the pushback of blocking it causes the opponent to hit the wall.

To hit the wall, then you also that also results in a crumple.

So that makes the Drive Impact always a threat if you're even sucked like kind of in the corner.

or if you're even remotely close to the corner.

And additionally, if you happen to be in a burnout state and in the corner when you block a Drive Impact then the results in a dizzy.

To my knowledge, I'm pretty sure that's the only way that you can be dizzied in this game.

And if that happens to you, it's basically the end of the round.

So that makes Drive Impact a very powerful move and always impact the Drive Impact.

a very powerful move and always, and basically always something that you need to look out for, but you know, it's way more dangerous when the opponent is somewhat near the corner and even more dangerous if they're in the corner and at burnout state.

So, because of that, the startup on it is pretty long.

I have to double check and see if it's the same for each character.

I don't expect that it would be, but I think there would only be a couple of frames of difference one way or the other if there was a difference.

But it's basically around a 21-frame startup which is a little over a third of a second.

doesn't seem like that much but you know but it is so now let's talk about the Okay, yeah, so now we'll talk about the weak points.

So yeah, the first, you know, weak point is that the startup of it is pretty long, even though when you're actually playing and you get hit by it, it doesn't seem like it's very long.

So how do you counter the Drive Impact.

Well the first way, the simplest counter is to do a Drive Impact of your own.

So this will allow you to absorb their hit and then do an encounter with the Drive Impact of your own which gives you the full crumple.

So and you don't have to hold it there's like no timing you basically just if you see it coming then you know you throw yours up out and whichever whichever one came out last whichever one was done last is the one that wins it is possible for them to hit on the exact same frame which causes them to.

.

.

it causes like a neutral state and both characters are pushed back pretty significantly but that's pretty rare.

I've only seen it once.

So that's the first counter to it.

The second thing is that you can throw the opponent out of the Drive Impact in its startup frames.

And I have to check and see exactly how many frames that is.

But yeah, you can throw them out of it, which means it's not really a move that you can-- It's not really a move that can be used on wake up even though it has two or three hits of armor.

But if the active frames are already out and you go for the throw, you're just going get hit and crumbled.

Okay, so the next counter to Drive Impact is.

.

.

is neutral jump and then to bait it out and then yeah neutral jump into a heavy button into a combo is a good counter to bait it out.

(water bubbling) (water running) (water running) And, okay, so the next counter is to do a move that has armor-breaking properties.

I'm not totally sure if every character has a move like this, but yeah, many of them do.

those are or oftentimes they're the level one supers like for example Guiles, Level 1 Sonic Hurricane, breaks Armor.

Yeah.

But, of course, yeah, and like, I'm sure a lot of the OG moves also Brakes Armor.

But usually, you know, like reversals like DP's or Giles Flashkick don't break armor.

So if they collide on the same, so if you try to use it to counter the Drive Impact, then the attacker just absorbs the hit and then it probably has enough time to punish you when you land.

So.

.

.

Oh.

(water splashing) [ Pause ] So if you see.

.

.

So, yeah.

So like in the neutral it's not that good.

Like.

.

.

Yeah, it's.

.

.

Well, yeah, like in the neutral It's not that good, unless less, you know, less it hits, but in the corner it's really good.

And the other thing to consider is that it's, it's, it's like even more dangerous in the corner when you're in burnout because when you're in burnout you can't drive impact you can't do a Drive Impact of your own.

So if you're in burnout that eliminates two of your main options to deal with it because number one you can't Drive Impact and number two if you can't use your OD moves.

So that means you're in the corner your only options are to super on reaction or to preemptively jump it yeah or to preemptively jump either out of the corner or neutral or backwards.

And even though you can.

.

.

Even though neutral jumping is a good way to preemptively punish the Drive Impact, It doesn't really seem like something you can do on a reaction, at least not when you're a close.

I think that has to do with the proximity blocking effect, which basically is where your character is stuck in blocks done when you're in range, when you're within the proximity range of the attack.

And this isn't something like there's no frame data for this.

So it's hard to measure, but I believe that's the reason why you're not able to jump out of it on reaction.

most of the time.

The other thing is that, okay, yeah, the other two things about using it offensively is that You can cancel your, it's special cancelable.

Like you can cancel your normals into a Drive Impact such that even if they block, if they're in burnout already, It's a.

.

.

in the corner it's a guaranteed dizzy.

So.

.

.

you know, like.

.

.

it's uh.

.

.

Yeah, it's like a.

.

.

I mean.

.

.

canceling normals into Drive Impact.

.

.

uh.

.

.

Yeah, it can be really effective in the corner.

So yeah, that's Drive Impact.

.

### chatGPT Draft 1 
# Drive Impact in Street Fighter 6

We talked about how Drive Rush Cancel and Parry Drive Rush are two of the three offensive systems of the Drive System as a whole. Now, let's discuss Drive Impact, which can be used offensively and defensively.

Imagine the Drive System as a pentagon with offensive options on the left and defensive options on the right. Square in the middle is the Drive Impact, because it can be used both offensively and defensively.

Drive Impact has three hits of armor (I need to double-check this). To perform Drive Impact, press Heavy Punch (HP) and Heavy Kick (HK) together, and your character will lunge forward with a mid-range, mid-level attack. If you've played Street Fighter 4, you might notice similarities between Drive Impact and Focus Attack, particularly the armor and the crumple state you get from hitting Level 2 or Level 3 Focus Attack.

In Street Fighter 6, there's only one level of Drive Impact, and you can't hold it to delay when it comes out. Hitting your opponent with Drive Impact costs one of your Drive Gauge stocks, and if it connects, you get a big crumple that lasts a long time. If blocked, the opponent is pushed back towards the corner, with frame advantage likely negated by the pushback distance. However, if Drive Impact is done close enough to the corner and the pushback causes the opponent to hit the wall, that also results in a crumple. If the opponent is in a burnout state and in the corner when they block Drive Impact, they become dizzied, which is the only way to be dizzied in this game.

Drive Impact has a startup of around 21 frames (I need to double-check if this is the same for each character), which seems long but is only a little over a third of a second.

# Countering Drive Impact

There are several ways to counter Drive Impact:

1.  Use a Drive Impact of your own to absorb their hit and counter with a full crumple. There's no timing involved; if you see it coming, throw yours out, and whichever one came out last wins. If they hit on the exact same frame, both characters are pushed back significantly, but this is rare.
2.  Throw the opponent out of Drive Impact during its startup frames (I need to check how many frames this is). This means Drive Impact can't be used on wakeup, even with its armor. However, if the active frames are already out and you go for the throw, you'll just get hit and crumpled.
3.  Neutral jump and bait Drive Impact, then use a heavy button into a combo to counter it.
4.  Use a move with armor-breaking properties (e.g., Guile's Level 1 Sonic Hurricane). Not all characters may have such a move, and typical reversals like Dragon Punches (DPs) or Guile's Flash Kick won't break armor. Attempting to counter Drive Impact with these moves will result in the attacker absorbing the hit and likely punishing you when you land.

Drive Impact is not very effective in neutral situations unless it hits, but it's more dangerous when used near or in the corner, especially against opponents in a burnout state. When in burnout, you can't use Drive Impact or Overdrive (OD) moves, limiting your options for countering it to using a super on reaction or preemptively jumping.

You can also cancel normals into Drive Impact. In the corner, this can be particularly effective, as it guarantees a dizzy against opponents who are already in burnout.

So, that's an overview of Drive Impact in Street Fighter 6.

**2. Drive Impact**

-   Drive Impact can be used both offensively and defensively, with similarities to Street Fighter 4's Focus Attack.
-   It costs one Drive Gauge stock.
-   The effects on hit, block, and corner situations are as follows:
    -   On hit, a crumple state is induced.
    -   On block, the opponent is pushed back.
    -   In corner situations, blocking may result in a crumple, and blocking while in burnout state leads to a dizzy.
-   The startup frames may differ slightly between characters, with an average of around 21 frames.

**3. Countering Drive Impact**

-   Counter options include:
    -   Using your own Drive Impact, which results in the later Drive Impact winning.
    -   Throwing the opponent during the startup frames.
    -   Neutral jumping followed by a heavy button combo.
    -   Utilizing armor-breaking moves, such as certain level one supers or OD moves.

**4. Drive Impact in different situations**

-   In the neutral game, Drive Impact is less effective unless it hits.
-   In corner situations, Drive Impact is more threatening, and during burnout, the opponent has limited counter options.

**5. Canceling normals into Drive Impact**

-   Drive Impact can be special-canceled from normals.
-   When an opponent in burnout state and in the corner blocks a normal canceled into Drive Impact, it guarantees a dizzy.
