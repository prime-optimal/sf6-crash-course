# Modern Controls
## What is it?
A brand new control scheme that reduces the damage output of some moves in exchange for significantly easier inputs. 


## Why is it important?
By lowering the execution barrier, players don’t need to spend as much time practicing in Training Mode.  This could be really appealing to casual players, but serious players may also benefit.


## How does it fit in with the big picture?
It’s somewhat of a wild card in the sense that it’s too early to tell what the real impact will be on the competitive landscape.  


## What are some ways to use it
- It can be useful for learning characters and matchups quickly because you don’t need to spend nearly as much time on building the muscle memory for different characters in order to get a feel for their playstyle. 
- It can definitely bridge the gap between casual players and serious players.  Casuals get to feel empowered and theoretically, it could level the playing field a little bit. 

## How does it work?
1.  Instead of three strengths of punch buttons and three strengths of kick buttons, the buttons are as follows:

	| blue (light)    | Special     | Parry       | Drive Impact |      |
	| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---- |
	| yellow (medium) | red (heavy) | Auto/Assist | Throw        |      |


## Examples
### Luke 
Luke seems quite capable with Modern controls.  He loses his B+HK which is his most damaging Punish Counter normal after blocking a DP or other high-risk move. 

#### Blue (Light)
