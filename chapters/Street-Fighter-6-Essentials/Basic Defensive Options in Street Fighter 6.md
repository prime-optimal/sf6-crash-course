Let's dive into the basic defensive options in Street Fighter 6, specifically when you're in the mid-game, having been knocked down and now facing an opponent bearing down on you as you get up. If you're uncertain about how to respond when under attack, remember, blocking is usually the right answer, around 80% of the time.

## Blocking 

Although not an exact science, more of a basic guideline, when you're recovering from a knockdown, blocking low is your safest bet. Blocking low protects you from low attacks and leaves you with just throws and high attacks or overheads to worry about.

This leads us to the rock-paper-scissors analogy of fighting games: blocking neutralizes attacking, throws beat blocking, and attacks beat throws. So if blocking is the safest thing to do, what about other situations? What are the other options?

## Teching Throws

In this section, we're going to delve into the concept of teching throws. Anytime your opponent is near you, it's crucial to remain aware that a throw is always a possibility. 

Throws are executed in five frames and you only have a small window to input your own throw, resulting in the throw being neutralized or 'teched.' This window is fairly small, making teching more of an educated guess than a reaction.

Be wary though, if the opponent baits out your throw and causes it to whiff because they were outside of the throw range, then you're left vulnerable. You're in recovery frames until the animation finishes, and during this time, you can be punished. This counter gives the opponent a 20% damage boost and a +4 on hit, allowing for Punish Counter-only combos.

A noteworthy shift between Street Fighter 5 and Street Fighter 6 is the effect after a throw is teched. In Street Fighter 6, the characters are pushed away from each other much further than they were in previous Street Fighter iterations like Street Fighter V, Street Fighter IV, and Third Strike. This means that opting for a throw as an attacker is slightly riskier, because if the defender techs the throw, not only is the situation reset, but you've lost a considerable amount of screen position that you might have worked hard to gain.

> If you input the throw command while crouching or blocking low, your character will stand up and the throw will be executed. You have to be mindful of this, because you could end up being punished and the situation could swiftly take a turn for the worse.

## Invincible Reversal

You could use an invincible reversal, such as a wake-up OD DP from previous Street Fighter games. In Street Fighter 6, only the OD invincible reversals seem to have invincibility on startup. This presents a risk because if the opponent blocks, they have ample time to punish you. A punish in this context is blocking a move and then counterattacking before the opponent can block. 

For instance, if Ryu does a wake-up ODDP and the attacker anticipates it correctly and blocks, then Ryu is high up in the air, and you can punish with a max damage combo. Being able to consistently execute a proper Punish Counter, particularly with invincible reversals, separates strong players from weak ones. 

## Anti-Airs

Another defensive option is using anti-airs. Characters with projectiles tend to have good anti-airs. An anti-air could be an invincible reversal, like Ryu's DP, or a normal such as his crouching Heavy Punch (cr. HP). 

## Defensive Options of the Drive System

Now, let's explore the defensive options offered by the Drive System.

### Drive Impact

Drive Impact (DI) can be used defensively against an attacker's DI. Most DIs have a 26 frame startup, which is a little over a third of a second, meaning that with practice, you should be able to react with your own DI. If that happens, the defender's DI will score a crumple, allowing a high-damage combo.

In Street Fighter 4, DI is somewhat the spiritual successor to Focus Attack, except this time around, it has two hits of armor instead of one. This means you need to connect with three hits total to break its armor. However, DI can be thrown and isn't particularly effective on wake-up or as an anti-air. 

### Drive Parry

Drive Parry, performed by pressing Medium Punch (MP) and Medium Kick (MK) simultaneously as an attack makes contact, prevents damage and builds your Drive Gauge with each hit parried. In many situations, you may parry something and not be able to counterattack, especially considering the frame advantage of the incoming move doesn't change. 

However, you can also hold down parry, which drains your Drive Gauge but auto-parries incoming hits regardless of whether the hit is high or low. If you mis-time it, you'll be in recovery frames, and getting hit counts as a Punish Counter, giving the attacker a 20% damage boost and an additional plus four frames on hit.

### Perfect Parry

Perfect Parry, with the same input as regular parry, can score a Perfect Parry if the parry connects on the first or second frame. This affords ample time for a high-damage combo, though the damage of the next combo is halved

 (scaled by 50%) following a Perfect Parry.

### Drive Reversal

Drive Reversal, done by pressing forward and Heavy Punch (HP) and Heavy Kick (HK) together while in block stun, costs two bars of the Drive Gauge. If the Drive Reversal connects, the attacker is knocked down and incurs gray life damage which slowly regenerates over time. However, if the Drive Reversal is blocked, it can be punished. 

Lastly, performing wake-up Supers can also serve as a defensive option, although it's risky. It could turn you into a genius or a fool, based on the result. Not only will a miscalculated attempt invite a high-damage punish, but it will also consume one or more of your super bars. Therefore, it's an option to be used judiciously.
