### Raw Transcript 
```text
Okay, so now let's talk about the defensive system, the defensive options of the drive system.

So, I guess let's talk about drive reversal first because it's the most straightforward.

So, drive reversal is similar, if you played Street Fighter V or the Alpha series, it's most similar to the reversal or Alpha counter.

So it's done by tapping forward and drive impact, heavy punch and heavy kick when you're in blocks done.

So this, so the move ends.

cancels the blocks done and then you do like a horizontal like lunging attack and if the opponent gets hit then they're knocked they get pushed back pretty far they're knocked down and they incur a Grey Life damage.

So Grey Life damage is recovers slowly after a few seconds.

But if you get hit, while you're.

.

.

if you get hit again, or if you get hit before the Grey Life recovers, that damage becomes permanent.

Uh.

.

.

I have to check and see if you can throw them out of it.

If you can throw them out of the driver versa on reaction, or the driver versa on reaction, but I don't think you can because that was one of the major problems with the reversal in Street Fighter V is that if you bated it out, you could just throw them.

So there's that.

The other thing is that if it's, you can, it also, oh, oh, the cost is two of your drive gauge stocks.

So you can't, you know, like, you can't use it like all the time.

And it can be, yeah, like each character's drive reversal is different, is a little different in terms of how much range it has.

So you have to be conscious of that because like if you throw it out when they're too far away then you whiff and I'm pretty sure if they hit you it counts as a punish counter.

And if they block the driver reversal, it's the, I think you're only like minus 2 or minus 3.

So you're safe if they block it, but it's Not your turn anymore, but you don't get your turn back.

The other thing about about a driver-versal is if it's parried, yeah, if the driver-versal is parried, the Defender has enough time to punish, you know, you can go into a full combo if you parry a driver-versal successfully.

But I have to look at how many startup frames, but I want to say it's pretty similar to drive impact.

So it's theoretically something that you can react to with a parry but you can't bait it out and throw them.

You might be, I'm pretty sure if you're close to them and you do it and you bait it out, I'm pretty sure you could also hold up and that would work too.

So that's driver or sole two bars of drive gauge stock.

So now, let's talk about the drive parry.

So if you played third strike or street fighter five, you're probably familiar with the parry.

It's done by pressing medium punch and medium kick together.

So the same input as V skill in Street Fighter V.

So if you played Ryu in Street Fighter V, then it basically works the same way as it did in that game, which is much different than the way that it worked in Third Strike, which is you would have to tap forward.

So it costs half a bar to attempt the parry.

But if the parry is successful, then you get the half bar back.

So, the way it works is you want to do the parry right as the move, as the attacker's move is making contact.

And so yeah, if it connects, like if the parry is successful, then you don't take any damage from the attack like it absorbs the hit and depending on the move you may be able to um.

.

.

to counter attack and uh.

.

.

i believe you get a i believe it'll count as uh.

.

.

a punish counter i'm not totally sure like what the window is i have to check uh.

.

.

the uh.

.

.

okay so the other thing about the parry makes it much different from previous iterations is that you can just hold the buttons down to parry multiple hits as opposed to needing to tap it with each hit that you're trying to parry.

So this makes parrying moves that hit multiple times super easy.

The other thing is that even though it, I feel like the window is six frames.

I think the window is six frames.

just say the Windows 6 frames.

So within that 6 frame window where you where the attack will be parried if you if it connects in the first like it if you parry in that six-frame window if the move makes contact in the first two frames of the parry then you get a perfect parry and you'll know that you got the perfect parry because the game slows down and there's this big animation effect kind of like the animation from hitting a drive impact successfully.

And The perfect parry allows for a huge window of time to counter-attack.

It's probably as much time as you get from hitting a drive impact.

Whereas with a regular parry, for most moves, you don't get enough frame advantage from landing a successful parry in order to-- like you don't get enough frame advantage to counter attack.

So, you know, that kind of, And to me that makes it like regular parry kind of weak.

Because in Third Strike, you know, you could.

.

.

Like, in third strike usually, um, in third strike if you got a parry, if you parried like a medium or heavy attack, that was usually, um, that would usually give you enough time to counterattack with like, you know, whatever your characters main, you know, combo starter was.

And, you know, that basically, oh, and even on a light attack, if you parried a light up close, you still had enough time to be able to throw the attacker.

So, you know, what that resulted in was the parry being like a very high reward mechanic in Third Strike.

It's Street Fighter V.

You know, regular parry isn't, you know, isn't high reward, but definitely the perfect parry is high reward.

But it's also high risk because just like in Street Fighter V, the parry has both startup frames and recovery frames.

Whereas in Third Strike, there basically were no startup frames.

So you could do a parry on wake up.

And because you're just tapping forward, if the opponent wasn't attacking, then there was no recovery animation, because you just tapped forward and nothing happened.

But starting in Street Fighter V and now coming into Street Fighter VI, there are startup frames and recovery frames on the parry, which means if the attacker If an attacker is doing, if an attacker has, if an attacker is timing, if the opponent is timing the attack, is timing a media attack to hit you right as you're getting up.

The media attack wins because the parry has a two frame startup.

So that means that you can't You can do the parry on wake up, but if the media attack connects on the first two frames of the parry, the parry loses.

So like, you know, like, that may not sound like, like, I would say it's too early to tell whether or not Wake Up Parry is going to be something that is a reliable option on Wake Up.

But I don't think it will be because it's basically designed not to be an omniscient or a um it's not supposed to be a strong wake-up option because in third strike it was arguably too strong of a wake-up option and in that game you always had to worry about wake-up parry because Because let's say if you were fighting a character like Yuri with like unblockables or like super high damage output, you know, the, you know, the defender can have, you know, you could be losing the entire round and then get one lucky wake-up parry and then totally, um, you know, switch totally switch the momentum up and you know, do a, you know, do like game changing damage, do like, yeah, do game changing damage off of parrying one low light attack.

You know, so I think they've basically toned down how good it is on wake up to prevent those situations.

The other thing about Perfic Perry is that you can't.

.

.

If you get a perfect parry, the damage scaling starts at 50%.

So I don't know if that's like the entire combo is just 50% damage scaling or it starts at 50% and goes lower with every hit that I don't know.

I have to check, but it's significant that the damage is reduced.

and also like even as a dirt strike player with years of parrying experience, I find whoa I find perfect parries to be really is really difficult.

It's also worth mentioning.

I haven't tested this myself.

Well, okay.

It's worth noting that it appears like the perfect parry can't be done.

Like, you have to.

.

.

The move has to make contact in those first.

.

.

Not only does the move have to make contact.

.

.

Or.

.

.

In those first two frames.

.

.

But like.

.

.

It appears like it doesn't benefit from the.

.

.

It doesn't benefit from the input buffering system like other inputs do.

For example, in Street Fighter V, Street Fighter V introduced either, I think it was a three-frame buffer, where you could, you could do a move like up to three or five frames early, and the game would just register it as coming out on the earliest possible frame, which made Link combos much, much easier to the point, to the level of.

.

.

It basically makes it so that one frame links aren't actually one frame because you had, because you could input the next hit of the console, the next hit of the combo up to three frames earlier or five frames and it would still and the game would count it as having, you know, come out on the first possible frame.

Whereas in Street Fighter IV, one-frame links really were one-frame links.

though the planking technique was discovered which allowed which basically lets you generate extra inputs to make those one-frame links easier to do.

So what does it mean that the parry doesn't benefit from the.

.

.

What does it mean that you can't input buffer the perfect parry.

Well that means that it actually has to hit on, it actually has to hit in that two frame window.

Otherwise, you get a regular parry and most likely you won't be able to punish the move.

So I'm pretty sure that means that because the parry has a two frame startup, you only have, you can only get the perfect parry on frames three and four.

And there's no input buffering, so you literally had a window of.

.

.

You have a one-thirtieth of a second window to hit the perfect parry.

And so if you hit it too.

.

.

Yeah, like the the attackers move has to collide with the parry on frames three or four in order to get the perfect parry.

If it's the four frame three the parry loses because it's still in the startup frames and if it's And if it's after and if it's the fourth If it's the fourth Sorry if it's the Fifth Okay, yeah, if it hits on.

.

.

Okay, let's start over.

If it hits, if the attack makes contact on frames one or two, the parry loses.

On frames 3 and 4 you get a perfect parry and then on frames 5 through 8 you get a regular parry and likely won't be able to counter attack with anything.

But after frame 8, you're in recovery frames, which means that if the opponent hits you, score a.

.

.

they'll get the punish counter frame and damage bonus.

So, um.

.

.

Yeah, I mean.

.

.

I don't know.

Me personally, I guess I haven't trained parries enough to feel like I'm a threat with them.

Because it just seems so daunting to.

.

.

It's like the risk reward is not.

.

.

Like the risk is really high and the reward is pretty low.

low even if you get the perfect parry there's still the 50% damage scaling.

But one way that it is that it does seem to be one situation that it does seem to be like pretty effective in is in a cross-up situation on wake-up.

So if the opponent is trying to if you're knocked down and the opponent goes for the cross-up, going for the parry is probably a pretty good option because Like, it doesn't.

.

.

Like, the parry will.

.

.

The parry will auto-correct.

So you don't need to.

.

.

You don't need to worry about blocking the opposite way.

And if you get the perfect parry.

.

.

Then.

.

.

Yeah, you have enough time to counter attack.

The other thing to note is that you cannot parry when you're in burnout mode because you have no bar.

Yeah, can't parry when you're in burnout.

Oh, and I guess it's also worth mentioning that you don't.

.

.

If you parry a special move, you don't take any chip damage.

parry a normal it doesn't decrease your drive gauge so that's parries.

# Drive Reversal and Drive Parry

## Drive Reversal

Drive reversal is similar to the reversal or Alpha counter in Street Fighter V or the Alpha series. It's executed by tapping forward and drive impact (HP and HK) when you're in block stun. This move cancels the block stun and performs a horizontal lunging attack. If the opponent is hit, they're pushed back, knocked down, and incur Grey Life damage. Grey Life damage recovers slowly after a few seconds, but if you get hit before the Grey Life recovers, the damage becomes permanent. The cost for drive reversal is two drive gauge stocks.

Each character's drive reversal has different range, so you need to be aware of that. If you whiff, there's a chance it counts as a punish counter if you get hit. If the opponent blocks the drive reversal, you're only about -2 or -3 on block, meaning you're safe, but it's not your turn anymore.

If the drive reversal is parried, the defender can punish with a full combo. The startup frames for drive reversal seem to be similar to drive impact, but it cannot be baited out and thrown like the reversal in Street Fighter V.

## Drive Parry

Drive parry is similar to the parry in Street Fighter III: Third Strike or Street Fighter V, executed by pressing MP and MK together. The same input as V skill in Street Fighter V. It costs half a bar to attempt the parry, but if the parry is successful, you get the half bar back. To parry, press the input right as the attacker's move is making contact.

A successful parry absorbs the hit, and depending on the move, you may be able to counterattack. Unlike previous iterations, you can hold down the buttons to parry multiple hits. The parry window is six frames. If you get a perfect parry (when the move makes contact within the first two frames of the parry), the game slows down with a big animation effect and allows for a huge window of time to counterattack. However, with a regular parry, you don't get enough frame advantage for most moves to counterattack.

In Third Strike, parry was a high reward mechanic, but in Street Fighter V and VI, regular parry is not high reward, while perfect parry is high reward but also high risk due to startup and recovery frames. Wake-up parry isn't as strong as it was in Third Strike. The parry has a two-frame startup, which means if a meaty attack connects on the first two frames of the parry, the parry loses.

> Note: Need to clarify whether damage scaling starts at 50% for the entire combo after a perfect parry or if it decreases further with every hit.

Perfect parries are challenging even for experienced players. Perfect parry doesn't seem to benefit from the input buffering system like other inputs, which means it has to hit within the two-frame window. If the attack makes contact on frames 1 or 2, the parry loses; on frames 3 and 4, you get a perfect parry; on frames 5 through 8, you get a regular parry and likely won't be able to counterattack. After frame 8, you're in recovery frames, and if the opponent hits you, they get a punish counter and damage bonus.

Parries are effective in cross-up situations on wake-up since the parry will auto-correct. Note that you cannot parry when in burnout mode because you have no bar. If you parry a special move, you don't take any chip damage. Parrying a normal move doesn't decrease your drive gauge.

Host: In today's episode, we'll be discussing the new mechanics introduced in Street Fighter 6: Drive Reversal and Drive Parry. Both mechanics play a crucial role in the game's defensive options, and understanding them can greatly improve your performance in matches.

## Drive Reversal

### Overview

Host: Let's start with Drive Reversal. This mechanic is similar to the V-Reversal in Street Fighter V and Alpha Counters from the Street Fighter Alpha series. It allows you to counter your opponent's offensive pressure at the cost of some Drive Gauge.

### Input and Execution

Guest: That's right! To perform a Drive Reversal, you need to input Forward plus Medium Punch and Medium Kick simultaneously while blocking an attack. Timing is crucial here, as you must input the command during blockstun.

### Mechanics

Host: Once executed, the character performs a counterattack that inflicts Grey Life on the opponent. The amount of Grey Life inflicted and the animation properties vary between characters, making each Drive Reversal unique.

### Strategy and Applications

Guest: Drive Reversal is a great tool to create space and relieve pressure, but it comes at the cost of some of your Drive Gauge. You'll need to manage your Drive Gauge wisely and consider when it's worth using Drive Reversal or saving it for other uses, like Drive Impact or Drive Parry.

### Notable Examples

Host: Some characters have particularly unique or strong Drive Reversals. For instance, Ryu's Drive Reversal pushes the opponent further back, giving him more breathing room, while Chun-Li's has a faster startup and quicker recovery.

## Drive Parry

### Overview

Host: Moving on to Drive Parry, this mechanic is reminiscent of parries in other fighting games. It allows you to deflect incoming attacks and potentially open up your opponent for a counterattack.

### Input and Execution

Guest: To perform a Drive Parry, you'll need to input Down, Down-Forward, Forward, followed by Medium Punch and Medium Kick simultaneously. The timing is strict, as you must input the command just as the opponent's attack is about to connect.

### Mechanics

Host: When you successfully perform a Drive Parry, the attacker's move is deflected, leaving them vulnerable to a counterattack. The defender recovers faster, giving them an opportunity to capitalize on the situation.

### Strategy and Applications

Guest: Drive Parry is a high-risk, high-reward mechanic. It can help you turn the tide of a match if you can predict your opponent's moves, but a missed parry leaves you vulnerable to attack. You'll need to weigh the risk and reward carefully and consider whether Drive Parry is the best option in a given situation.

### Notable Examples

Host: Some characters have particularly unique or strong Drive Parries. For example, Zangief's Drive Parry not only deflects the attack but also grants him armor, allowing him to absorb additional hits and punish his opponent.

That should cover the basics of Drive Reversal and Drive Parry in Street Fighter 6. Mastering these mechanics can greatly improve your defensive game, so keep practicing, and you'll see the results in your matches. Good luck, and see you next time!
