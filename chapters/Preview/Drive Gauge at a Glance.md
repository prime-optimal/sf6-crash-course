# Drive Gauge
## What is it?
Drive Gauge is a resource that can be used offensively and defensively.  Both players start every round fully stocked with 6 bars.

## Why is it important?
- It starts at 100% each round.
- It doesn't carry over to the next round, therefore there's no point in saving it/dying with it.
- 

## How does it fit in with the big picture?
- In SFV, your EX moves and your Critical Art came used the same bar, meaning you would sometimes have to choose between being able to use your EX and doing a CA.  Now, they are separate.
- Since it refills each round, you don't need to worry about conserving it for the next round. 
- It can be used to extend combos ([[Drive Rush]]) put them in okizeme situations (Drive Rush), or as a counter ([[Drive Counter]])
- You lose Drive Gauge when you block, which penalizes overly defensive strategies.  

## What are some ways to use it
- OD (or EX) moves cost 2 bars
- Drive Rush costs 3 bars
- Drive Counter costs X bars.  
- Drive Impact is similar to focus attack and costs 1 bar.
- Parry attempts cost 0.5 bar

## How does it work?
1. You start each round with a full Drive Gauge (6 bars)
2. OD Special Moves do more damage and have different properties such as knockdown, juggle state, wall bounce, etc.
3. Combos can be extended with Drive Rush.
4. Mixups can be initiated by canceling a Normal into Drive Rush.

```

6. Drive Impact can be used like a Focus attack, absorbing multiple hits.
7. Drive Counter is similar to an Alpha Counter or V-Reversal, allowing the defender to push the attacker off. 
8. Each bar takes about five seconds to regenerate after it's used.  Blocking will stop the bar from regenerating. 

## Examples
### OD Special Moves
- Ryu's EX Donkey Kick gives him a wall bounce that can combo into Super. 
- Ken's EX Dragon Kick gives him a ground bounce and a side switch that can combo into HP DP. 
- Kimberly's EX Spin Kick gives her invincibility on startup, making it a strong "get off me" defensive move. 

# [[Drive Rush]]
- Ryu's Axe Kick -> blocked -> LP Palm -> HP DP xx Level 3
- Ryu's st. HP -> blocked -> LK Donkey Kick *trade* -> HP DP
- Ken's TC1 -> hit -> 

# [[../../../../System Mechanics/Drive Impact]]
- Similar to Focus Attack
- On block with them in the corner, you get a crumple.
- Midscreen, you generally only get pushback.
- Can absorb 3 hits.
- 26F startup.
