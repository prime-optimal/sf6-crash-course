```ad-quote
I don't care how great you are and how much you succeed, but without self-love, you're nothing.  

'Cause self-love is discipline, and discipline is doing what you hate to do, but do it like you love it.

# Cultivating a Winner’s Mindset
As with anything in life that you're learning or trying to get better at, your mindset is one of the most important components of the entire process. In the world of fighting games, your mindset can greatly influence your success or failures. In this section, we will explore how to cultivate a winning mindset and improve your overall performance in Street Fighter 6.

## Accept the Process
To cultivate a winning mindset, you must first accept that improvement is a process and that nobody ever became great overnight. 

In your journey to get better, there will be highs and lows, victories and defeats. 

Treat each match as a learning experience, and remember that everything is practice.

## Commit to Always Be Learning
It's essential to commit to consistently learning, as there is always something new to discover. Instead of spending all your time playing game after game, focus on dedicating time to learning new strategies, techniques, and characters.

One concept that has helped me in my journey to become a better fighting game player is the idea of getting 1% better every day, as explained by James Clear in his book, Atomic Habits. This approach emphasizes the power of consistent, incremental improvements over time. By learning new characters and diversifying my playstyle, I was able to make small daily progress, which compounded and led to significant overall growth as a player.

By embracing the concept of getting 1% better every day, you can significantly enhance your growth and enjoyment of the game, without it feeling like a chore.

## Learn from Failure
Failure is just feedback. Treat defeat as a temporary setback and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow. 

If you struggle against certain characters, take responsibility for not knowing how to deal with them and commit to learning more about their strengths and weaknesses.

If you struggle with hitting your combos at critical moments, take responsibility for your poor execution, rather than blaming your opponent or the controller. 

## Learn Multiple Characters
Understanding various characters' perspectives will help improve your overall knowledge base and enable you to better predict your opponent's moves. Learning multiple characters can also provide long-lasting benefits, as character knowledge can often carry over between different games in a series.

When I first started playing fighting games, I made the mistake of sticking to just one character. While it's true that specializing in a single character can help you master their moveset and develop a deep understanding of their playstyle, it can also limit your growth as a player. Expanding your knowledge and skill set by learning multiple characters can greatly enhance your ability to adapt and understand various matchups.

In my early years, I focused primarily on playing Urien in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike. Urien, known for his unique playstyle, high damage output, and unblockable Aegis Reflector setups, was a character that I found extremely engaging. I spent countless hours practicing combos and honing my skills with Urien, as well as competing in local and regional tournaments. This dedication led me to become a formidable Urien player, but it also limited my understanding of other characters and matchups in the game.

By limiting myself to one character, I consistently struggled in certain matchups for the lifespan of the game. This would then lead to struggling against certain players that I would often go up against, which lead to more frustration and mental blocks.

## Watch and Analyze Replays
Instead of getting frustrated and trying to forget about a loss, take the time to watch your replays and identify areas for improvement. Analyzing your gameplay can help you better understand the choices you made during the match and how you can adjust your strategy for future games.

It can be tempting to immediately hit the rematch button or find the next online match, but it’s far more productive to take a moment and rewatch the match.  

If you’ve commmited to learning new characters, you’ll find that it also greatly enhances your ability to analyze and appreciate other players' matches, as well as your own. 

When watching gameplay of any skill level, you can better understand the intricacies of each character's playstyle, as well as the strategies and decision-making processes behind each move. This deeper understanding of multiple characters allows you to learn from other players more effectively and apply those lessons to your own gameplay.

Additionally, learning multiple characters can help you connect with other players within the fighting game community. 

By being knowledgeable about various characters, you can engage in more meaningful discussions, share tips and strategies, and form stronger bonds with players who share your passion for the game. 

```ad-example

During the early stages of my competitive career, I traveled to the East Coast to participate in a team tournament with the goal of qualifying for the prestigious Super Battle Opera (SBO) in Japan. My teammate, Ed Ma, and I did not perform well, failing to make it anywhere close to the finals.

One of the teams that defeated us consisted of Fubarduck, a Chun-Li player, and Mopreme, a Ryu player, both from Austin, Texas. After the tournament, we had a chance to hang out and discuss the matches. Mopreme then offered me an invaluable piece of advice about Urien.

He asked me why I never placed the Aegis Reflector in front of my opponents when they were in the corner, as I always placed it on top of or behind them. I hadn't thought about it before, but once I integrated this advice into my gameplay, I saw instant results. This strategy served me well for the rest of my time playing Urien.

What struck me the most about this situation was that Mopreme was not a Urien specialist; in fact, I wasn't even sure if he played Urien at all. 

However, his knowledge of the character was sufficient to provide valuable advice to someone who considered themselves a Urien specialist. This experience demonstrated the importance of learning different characters in fighting games. 

You don't have to be a character specialist to benefit from understanding various characters, and this knowledge can positively impact your gameplay and growth as a player.

```

## Conclusion
Cultivating a winner's mindset is crucial for success in fighting games. 

By embracing the process, committing to learning, learning from failures, understanding multiple characters, and analyzing replays, you'll be on the path to becoming a stronger and more resilient player. 

Remember that the key to improvement is consistent effort, and with the right mindset, you'll be able to overcome any challenges that come your way.
