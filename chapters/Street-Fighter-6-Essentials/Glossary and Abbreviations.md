### Glossary

-   **Critical Art**: A powerful, cinematic special move that requires a full EX Gauge to perform.
-   **Drive Gauge**: A three-section meter that builds up during combat, used for various mechanics such as Drive Impact, Drive Reversal, and Drive Parry.
-   **Drive Impact**: A unique move for each character, performed by pressing Heavy Punch + Heavy Kick simultaneously, that uses one section of the Drive Gauge.
-   **Drive Reversal**: A defensive move performed during block stun that interrupts the opponent's offense and inflicts Grey Life damage. This move consumes two sections of the Drive Gauge.
-   **Drive Parry**: A mechanic that allows players to parry incoming attacks, costing half a bar of Drive Gauge, but refunding it if the parry is successful.
-   **Burnout**: A mode characters enter when their Drive Gauge is empty, limiting their ability to use moves that require Drive Gauge.
-   **Chip Damage**: Damage taken when blocking special moves and Critical Arts. Parrying these moves will prevent chip damage.
-   **Grey Life**: Recoverable health that characters temporarily lose when taking chip damage or being hit by a Drive Reversal. It recovers slowly over time if the character avoids taking further damage.
-   **Startup Frames**: The number of frames it takes for a move to become active after the input is executed.
-   **Recovery Frames**: The number of frames it takes for a character to return to a neutral state after executing a move.
-   **Frame Advantage**: The difference in recovery time between the attacker and defender after an attack is blocked or hits, measured in frames.
-   **Punish**: A move that can be used to take advantage of an opponent's unsafe attack, typically during its recovery frames.
-   **Focus Attack (Street Fighter 4)**: A move that allows characters to absorb a single hit while charging a powerful, unblockable attack. This mechanic shares some similarities with Drive Impact in Street Fighter 6, as both moves are unique to each character and have offensive and defensive applications.
-   **V-Reversal (Street Fighter 5)**: A defensive move performed during block stun that uses one section of the V-Gauge to interrupt the opponent's offense. This mechanic is similar to Drive Reversal in Street Fighter 6, as both moves are used to interrupt an opponent's offense and inflict some form of damage (Grey Life in SF6).
-   **Alpha Counters (Street Fighter Alpha series)**: Defensive moves performed during block stun that use a portion of the Super Meter to counterattack the opponent. These moves are also similar to Drive Reversal in Street Fighter 6, with both mechanics serving as a defensive option to interrupt an opponent's offense during block stun.
