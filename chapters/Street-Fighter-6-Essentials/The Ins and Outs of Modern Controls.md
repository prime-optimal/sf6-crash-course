In this section we‚Äôre going to go into detail about Modern Controls.  If you‚Äôve already decided that you‚Äôre going to play with Classic Controls, feel free to skip this section. 

## Normals (Light, Medium, and Heavy Attacks)
Instead of having three punches and three kicks with light, medium, and heavy versions of each, you have just light, medium, and heavy attacks.  They are denoted in-game by blue, yellow, and red buttons respectively. 

As you might expect, we‚Äôre going to use Ryu as an example.

### Gone, but not Forgotten 
Experienced Ryu players might notice that there are a few moves missing from the list:
- st. MK 
- B+HP 
- j. MP

It‚Äôs unfortunate that st. MK is gone, as that‚Äôs one of his best pokes, but to make up for it, his two target combos are slightly easier:
- st. Medium, Medium, Medium - 3-hit target combo that is unsafe on block, but with practice, you have enough time to hit-confirm the last hit and stop yourself if they‚Äôre blocking. 
- st. Heavy, Heavy - 2-hit target combo that knocks down, but is also unsafe on block.  This, too, can be hit-confirmed with practice. 

## The AUTO Button 
The AUTO Button acts similar to the Shift button on a keyboard.  

You can hold it while pressing an Attack or Special, and you‚Äôll get a different version.  

These sometimes auto-stand or auto-crouch your character when doing the AUTO attack, which could be useful or annoying, depending on the situation. 

> [!tip] It‚Äôs also worth noting that you don‚Äôt need to hold the AUTO button when pressing an Attack or SP, you can also press it at the same time.

The AUTO button also leads to Assisted Combos.  Each seems like each character has three AUTO Assisted Combos. 

For example, with Ryu:

- AUTO + Light, Light: Standing light kick into Donkey Kick
- AUTO + Medium, Medium: cr. MP xx OD Palm; press a third time to combo into Level 2 super
- AUTO + Heavy, Heavy: Solar Plexus Strike (F+MP), cr. MP xx OD Fireball; press a third time to cancel into Level 3 super

## The Special (SP) Button 
Now we'll move on to the Special (SP) button. 

The major selling point of Modern Mode is that you have access to one-button specials, which reduces the execution barrier significantly. 

For example, with Ryu, if you just press neutral Special, then he gets a Medium. Forward + SP gives him a MP DP, and B + SP gets him the Tatsu; down special gets the donkey kick, all of them being the medium versions.

But you can still access the exact strengths of the moves by doing the full motion and hitting the button that corresponds to the strength you want. 

> [!tip] With Modern Controls, Ryu can only access the Palm (Hashogeki) by doing the full QCB + L/M/H motion. 
>  *Because of this, he only has access to MK Donkey Kick and MK Tatsu in Modern.*

## OD Moves 
To do the OD version of a special move, you hold AUTO and press SP (or press them simultaneously), while holding the direction for the desired special. 

Alternatively, you can do OD moves by pressing any two of the three Attack buttons when you do the motion manually.

> [!tip] The only way to do an OD Donkey Kick is with the SP button.

## Drive Parry and Drive Impact 
By default, you also have the parry button. As a Hitbox and stick player, I always have parry set to one button anyway, so this is not much of a change. 

The same goes for Drive Impact.  

I prefer to reduce the margin for error wherever possible and there‚Äôs less that can go wrong by using one button for these moves.  

With Classic controls, you do have the option to manually press LP+LK or HP+HK together, rather than setting them to their own buttons.  

However, with Modern, there is no way to do these moves without having a button set to them. 

## Throws
By default, there‚Äôs also the throw button, which is normally performed with LP+LK.  

With Modern Controls, it can also be performed by pressing Light + Medium. 

This means that you could set the throw button to something else if you preferred, while still having access to throws.

But what would you even set the button to?  

I‚Äôm glad you asked!

## Single-Button Supers 
With Modern Controls, not only can you perform one-button specials with the SP button, Super inputs are reduced to SP + Heavy. 

Neutral SP + Heavy ‚Üí Level 1 Super 
Back + SP + Heavy ‚Üí Level 2 Super 
Down + SP + Heavy ‚Üí Level 3 Super 

Pretty easy compared to QCF, QCF+P for sure.  

Yes there is damage scaling, so it does about 20% less damage, but that can be avoided by doing the full motion for the Super: 

QCF, QCF + Light ‚Üí Level 1 Super 
QCB, QCB + Medium ‚Üí Level 2 Super 
QCF, QCF + Heavy ‚Üí Level 3 Super 

***But wait, there‚Äôs more!*

If you go into Button Config, you‚Äôll find that it‚Äôs indeed possible to set one of your buttons to Heavy+SP!  ü§Ø 

This allows you to do a literal one-button Super!  And of course, you can do a Level 2 with Back + (SP+Heavy), and a Level 3 with Down + (SP + Heavy).  

Now you can buffer Ryu‚Äôs cr. MK aka crouching Medium from pretty far away from the opponent, while pressing your Super button shortly after.  If it makes contact with the opponent, the Super comes out.  If cr. MK whiffs, nothing comes out.  

Of course it also makes previously difficult combos ***much easier***, but it also makes it easy to punish moves on reaction, as well as on Reversal.  Anything that is -5 on block is now much easier to punish with a Reversal Level 3, or anything that‚Äôs -8 on block with a Level 1.

It also makes canceling Specials into your Super much easier as well.  

For example, in the corner, Ryu can hold down, press Medium for cr. MK, then press SP for the Donkey Kick, then press the Super button to cancel into his Level 3.  ***All while continuing to hold down!*** 

Remember, there is a damage scaling penalty when doing the Super like this, about 20%, but if you‚Äôre new to fighting games or just don‚Äôt want to invest the time it takes to build the muscle memory required to do it the ‚Äúold fashioned way‚Äù, it‚Äôs a surefire way to hit your combos every time. 



In modern mode, players can perform one button specials and supers, significantly reducing the execution barrier. For Ryu, neutral special results in a medium fireball, forward special gives a DP, back special gives a Tatsu, and down special gives a donkey kick (all medium versions). However, different strengths of moves can still be accessed by performing the full motion and pressing the desired strength button.

One button supers can be done by pressing heavy and special at the same time. Pressing these buttons in different directions will result in different super levels (neutral for level 1, back for level 2, and down for level 3). Setting one of the buttons to special and heavy allows for one button supers, which can be faster and easier than performing full motions.

4. Damage scaling and decision making

Modern mode's damage scaling might make it less appealing for some players, but the trade-off is that it reduces the need to spend time building muscle memory and perfecting combos. Instead, players can focus on character matchups and making correct decisions during gameplay. It's up to each player to decide which approach they prefer.
