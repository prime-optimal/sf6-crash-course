# Choosing A Character

```ad-tip
title: tl;dr
When choosing a character in a fighting game, prioritize learning the game mechanics and select characters with shared inputs for faster improvement. Ryu is an excellent starting point for beginners, as he's an average, accessible character. Alternatively, consider Luke, who's strong, easy to execute, and shares inputs with Ryu.
```

Selecting the right character to use in a fighting game can significantly impact your enjoyment and success. It's essential to find a character that suits your playstyle and helps you learn the game mechanics effectively.

My first year of college, I was playing a lot of fighting games, from CVS2, to Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.  This was the pre-YouTube era.  I would scour the forums for fighting game videos, especially combo videos.  
 
A friend sent me this Urien video made buy a guy named John D. Rockefeller. In it were the some of the sickest combos I'd ever seen in a fighting game.  I knew instantly I was going to do everything it took to be able to do those combos in real matches. 

So I know how it feels to see something really cool and then instantly want to play it.

I get it.

But here's the thing.

Just because a character, combo, or setup is cool doesn't mean that it's the best way to get good at the game.  Or Or that you should immediately try to play it.

When I first encountered Urien in a combo video during college, it inspired me to become a serious competitive Third Strike player. I understand the excitement of discovering a character that resonates with you, but it's crucial to consider whether they're practical to learn and whether they're a strong choice in the game.

#### Finding the Right Character
In 2008, when I made the transition from 3rd strike to Street Fighter IV, I struggled with finding a character to play.

I didn't really like the feel and the aesthetic of the game at the time.

It took some time before I finally settled on a main, which was Balrog.

And even though I had success, even though I enjoyed a lot of success with Balrog, I never really took the time to try everybody.

Remember this was the arcade days of 2008.  There really wasn't much time to experiment because there was always a huge line to play.

I was just trying to stay on the machine as best I could, which meant there really it was little to no time for any experimentation.

As I progressed in SF4, I learned the importance of learning multiple characters, which lead me to understand that the most effective way of learning a Street Fighter game is through the eyes of Ryu.

But why is that? 

1.  _He's the game's poster character:_ Ryu is on the cover of almost every Street Fighter game. As an average character in terms of speed, damage, and abilities, he's designed to be accessible and a good starting point.
    
2.  _Ryu is an effective way to learn the game:_ If you already have a basic knowledge of Ryu, you can focus on learning the new game mechanics and systems.
    
3. *There are many existing strong Ryu players:* Because heâ€™s such a popular character, there is no shortage of great Ryu players to learn from.  Players like Alex Valle, Daigo Umehara, John Choi, Tokido, and XSK Samurai are just a small sample of great Ryu players from throughout the various eras that you can learn from.

Some players may find Ryu "boring" or too common, but focusing on effectiveness and winning is more important than catering to those preferences.

## Learning to Play Luke: A Strong Alternative
If you don't want to start with Ryu, my alternative suggestion is to learn Luke. He was the last DLC character in Street Fighter V, and he's quite strong in that game. 

His inputs are similar to Ryu's, making his execution straightforward.

Luke is on the cover of Street Fighter VI, which indicates he's likely meant to be a strong character. Unlike other powerful characters that require a high level of technical skill and knowledge to play effectively, Luke has lower execution requirements, making him more accessible. 

He's like Shoto v2.0, with a faster fireball, better range on his DP, and simple yet useful target combos.

And if you took the time to learn him in SFV, that experience carries over to the new game. 

However, you might have reservations about using him if you find his design annoying, or if you consider him too strong in Street Fighter V and don't want to win with a "cheap" character.

Luke seems designed to be annoying, perhaps to level the playing field for less experienced players, like a younger sibling.  Imagine a little brother that you can usually beat in most games, but for some reason struggle against him in this game when he uses Luke.  

How annoying would that be?  ðŸ¤£ 

Capcom seems to be trying to bring in a new generation of Street Fighter players with him. 

Since he's so strong, heâ€™s worth exploring as your main character option as well as to counter the numerous other players using him.

The best way to learn how to fight against a character is to use that character yourself.

It's either adapt and learn Luke or risk losing to all the little brothers of the world.
