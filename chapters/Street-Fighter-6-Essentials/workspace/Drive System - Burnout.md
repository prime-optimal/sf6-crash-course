# Burnout Mode
## What is it?
- Burnout is a weakened state you enter if you run out of Drive Gauge.


## Why is it important?
- While in Burnout, you lose access to all abilities that require Drive Gauge such as:
	- Drive Impact 
	- Drive Parry 
	- Drive Reversal 
	- Drive Rush 
	- Parry Drive Rush 
	- OD Moves 
- All attacks you block gain an additional +4F.
- If the opponent connects with Drive Impact, you get dizzied. 

## How does it fit in with the big picture?
- Drive Impact is immediately more of a threat because you'll get dizzied even if you block. 
- Because the opponent’s attacks now have an additional four frames of advantage, they can pester you with block strings that wouldn’t work otherwise.
- You have fewer offensive and defensive options until your Drive Gauge regenerates. 
- It’s more likely to happen later in the round, which means if you’re in Burnout and get dizzied, it’s likely the end of the round. 


## What are some ways to avoid it
- Don’t waste your Drive Gauge on OD Moves, Drive Rush Cancels, Drive Reversals, etc. 
- Pay attention to your Drive Gauge so you don’t accidentally use your bar on something. 
- Use Drive Reversal to get them off of you. 

## How does it work?
- If you’re in Burnout, you can be chipped out by Supers and Specials. 
- Even though you don’t have access to any of your Drive System moves, you can still do Supers. 
- Blocked attacks gain +4 frame advantage, turning moves that normally have negative frame advantage into neutral or positive frame advantage (-2 moves become +2).
