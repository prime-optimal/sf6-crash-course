# Basic Offensive Pressure in Street Fighter 6

## The Neutral Game

The round starts in the neutral game, with both players standing and ready to make their first move. This is the moment when the announcer says "Round One, Fight!" and you must make your first decision. 

Generally, your basic options are to attack, throw a projectile (if your character has one), or do nothing, waiting to see what your opponent does. Overextending at the beginning of the round can lead to a difficult start and potentially being on the defensive for the rest of the round. 

Your choice of action generally depends on your confidence and familiarity with your character and the matchup. Personally, with most characters, I often start by walking forward to see how close I can get to my opponent without taking damage.

This usually transitions into what's referred to as footsies, where both players move in and out of their optimal attack ranges, trying to catch the other player whiffing a normal attack or throwing out an unsafe projectile. Success in this phase of the game often depends on your ability to impose your will on your opponent, aiming to land the first major hit.

## Understanding Ranges and Countering Jumps

Good footsies require a strong understanding of the reach of your normal attacks and the range of your opponent's normal attacks. Inexperienced players often struggle with this aspect and end up getting cornered without putting up much of a fight.

Once your opponent realizes they can't outmaneuver you on the ground, many will opt to jump forward. This is a common response and you need to be prepared to counter it. 

For example, when I'm using Ryu and advancing towards the corner, while using normals like crouching Medium Kick and standing Medium Kick, I also watch for a potential jump from my opponent, ready to respond with an anti-air DP or crouching Heavy Punch.

## Scoring a Knockdown

Scoring a knockdown, perhaps with Ryu's crouching Heavy Kick (sweep), leads to another decision point. After being knocked down, your opponent can either do nothing and take the automatic quick rise, or they can back roll, putting more distance between you but moving them closer to the corner.

## Drive Rush and Parry Drive Rush

In Street Fighter 6, a new offensive option from the start of any round is the Drive Rush. 

Both Drive Rush and Parry Drive Rush start with a green flash, swiftly sliding the character across the screen. This action adds extra frames of hitstun, providing +4 on hit or block to the original number.

For instance, Ryu's forward Medium Punch overhead is normally +2 on hit. However, if you execute a Parry Drive Rush overhead, it becomes +6 on hit. This allows Ryu sufficient time to link into standing or crouching Medium Punch, which can then be cancelled into a special move of your choice, enabling combos that are only possible in Drive Rush.

Parry Drive Rush only costs one of your stocks, while a regular Drive Rush costs three stocks of your Drive Gauge. Both are important tools in the game and we'll delve into them more in a later chapter.

## OD Moves and Drive Gauge

Another new feature in Street Fighter 6 for early game offensive pressure is the ability to use your Drive Gauge on OD moves, which are powered up special moves. At the start of every round, you begin with six bars, theoretically allowing you to throw out three OD moves, such as projectiles. This can potentially make the match pace quicker from the start.

You can also start with a Parry Drive Rush which only costs one bar, compared to OD moves costing two bars and Drive Rush costing three. 

For instance, you could use Drive Rush as a follow-up to a whiff punish from a distance. Many characters have a Medium Punch kick, either standing or crouching, that can be performed from a distance and is cancellable, such as Ryu's crouching Medium Kick or Can's standing Medium Kick.

So, at the beginning of the round, there are three main ways to use your Drive Gauge: 

1. **Parry Drive Rush** which costs one stock and gives all your normals an additional +4 on hit or block.
2. **OD moves** similar to the EX moves in previous Street Fighter games, costing two bars or one third of your total drive gauge.
3. **Drive Rush** which is a normal cancelled into a dash as the normal makes contact with the opponent. This costs three stocks of your Drive Gauge.

Both Parry Drive Rush and Drive Rush give the aggressor a way to put the defender into a mix-up situation early in the round due to the extra frames on hit and block.

## Changes from Street Fighter 5 to Street Fighter 6

One of the biggest changes from Street Fighter 5 to Street Fighter 6 is the change in frame advantage. In Street Fighter 5, many normals had plus frames of advantage, with being +2 considered very good. In Street Fighter 6, however, few normals, if any, are even or negative, with many being zero frames. 

Ryu, for example, has his standing Heavy Kick, which is +1 on block, but only connects on standing opponents. His forward Heavy Punch is also +1, but has a slow startup. Therefore, his best up-close normal is his crouching Medium Punch, which is zero on block. This change means that frame traps don't work the same as they did in Street Fighter 5, since being close to the opponent with plus frames is rare, leading to a different dynamic in scoring counter hits and applying pressure.

## Transitioning to Mid Game

The first knockdown, anti-air, or combo marks the end of the early game. Each round is divided into the early game, mid game, and late game, and the transition into the mid game occurs once the first major hit is landed. This point represents the start of significant decision making. For instance, if the defender gets knocked down, they must decide how to recover.

In the next section, we will delve into the dynamics of the first knockdown decision.
