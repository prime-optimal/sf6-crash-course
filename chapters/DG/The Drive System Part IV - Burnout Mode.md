## What is Burnout Mode?

Burnout is a weakened state that you enter if you run out of Drive Gauge. You start with six bars, and since so much of the game revolves around the use of Drive Gauge, both on offense and on defense, it's likely that over the course of several rounds, you will use up all of your Drive Gauge.

### Entering Burnout Mode

#### Running out of Drive Gauge

You can run out of Drive Gauge either by spending it all and then needing to recharge, or by having your Drive Gauge depleted by blocking the opponent's attacks. 

On offense, you can spend your Drive Gauge on various moves, such as Overdrive (OD) moves, which cost two bars, or Drive Rush cancels, which take three bars. 

On defense, using Drive Reversal costs two bars, attempting a parry costs half a bar, and most importantly, blocking attacks causes your Drive Gauge to decrease.

#### Offense and Defense usage of Drive Gauge

Both on offense and defense, your Drive Gauge will automatically replenish itself over time, as long as you're not using it, blocking, or getting hit. 

> [!tip]
> Getting hit causes your Drive Gauge to stop replenishing, but you don’t lose any Drive Gauge when you get hit, with the exception of all Supers.

### Effects of Burnout Mode

#### Losing access to abilities requiring Drive Gauge

When you're in Burnout, you lose access to all abilities that require Drive Gauge, such as Drive Impact, Drive Parry, Drive Reversal, Drive Rush, Parry Drive Rush, and your OD moves. This puts you at a significant disadvantage because you lose access to so many options.

#### Getting dizzied by opponent's Drive Impact

If the opponent makes contact with their Drive Impact while you're in Burnout and near the corner, even if you're blocking, you get dizzied. This makes Drive Impact even more of a threat, especially if you're in Burnout late in the round.

> [!tip] 
> Remember that blocking a Drive Impact costs ½ a bar.  This means if you have less than ½ of a stock left, blocking a Drive Impact will cause a dizzy!  This means you’re in danger of being dizzied, *even if you’re not yet Burnt Out!*

#### Extra block advantage for the opponent

When you're in Burnout, the attacks that you block grant an extra four frames of block advantage for the attacker (***not for you***). 

This means that moves that were minus (negative frame advantage) under non-Burnout circumstances now become plus (positive frame advantage), creating new block strings and frame traps that are only possible when the defender is in Burnout.

### Managing Drive Gauge

Burnout Mode forces you to manage your Drive Gauge as best you can and gives you an incentive to keep an eye on the opponent's Drive Gauge, as well as try to control theirs. 

It encourages you to play smart with your Drive Gauge and not waste it unnecessarily, as running out of Drive Gauge will leave you in Burnout for quite some time.

This adds a new layer of strategy not seen before in previous Street Fighter games because there can be situations where you are forced to choose whether it’s worth it to enter Burnout for the sake of a higher damage combo.

You might also unexpectedly enter Burnout by using your Drive Impact to absorb theirs.  

On defense, you might choose to use the last of your meter on a Drive Reversal in an attempt to fend off your opponent while cornered.  If it hits, they’ll be knocked down and pushed across the screen, potentially buying you the time and space needed to stop their momentum, take a breath, and regain control. 

Of course, a savvy opponent knows this is one of your main options and will be on the lookout for you to use the last of your bar on a Drive Reversal, potentially baiting it out and punishing accordingly. 

> [!tip]
> It’s worth noting that even though your Overdrive Arts all cost different amounts of Drive Gauge (DI costs 1 bar, Drive Reversal costs 2 bars, Drive Rush Cancel costs 3 bars, etc.), you don’t need to have that amount of meter in order to do the move. 
> 
> You have access to all of your Overdrive Arts as long as you have even a sliver of Drive Gauge left.  There doesn’t seem to be any penalty for going into “Drive Gauge Debt”, as the Burnout recovery time will be the same no matter how you ended up there.
> 
> For example, on the surface it might seem like you can only do at most three OD Moves before you Burn Out (each OD Move costs two and you only have six total), but you can *“steal"* a fourth one in as long as you waited a brief moment for your bar to start recovering.  


### Fighting While Burnt Out
Whether you willingly (*or carelessly*) spent the last of your bar or had your Drive Gauge eaten up by blocking your opponent’s attacks, once you’re in Burnout, you must begin moving or attacking for the meter to start refilling.  

> [!tip] 
> Burnout lasts at most ***about 20 real-life seconds***, which can be an eternity!  

#### Ways to speed up the Drive Gauge recovery time:
- Blocking attacks increases your Drive Gauge in chunks. 
- Making contact with your attacks, whether they hit or are blocked, also increases your Drive Gauge in chunks.
- Getting dizzied by a Drive Impact will cause your Drive Gauge to immediately refill after the dizzy is over (***assuming you are still alive*** 🤣 )

So whether you used the last of your meter on offense or defense, you are incentivized to go on the offensive in order to recover sooner.  

If you have the opponent cornered, it might make sense to use up the remainder of your Drive Gauge in order to do extra damage or to cause a crumple or dizzy state.  

Even though you'll be in Burnout, you’ll likely be able to continue the offensive pressure on their wakeup or reduce your risk by taking a step back and baiting the opponent to overextend and punishing accordingly.  

Because you have them cornered, you have the entire screen to work with and can safely apply pressure while inching backwards.  

Although you lose access to all of your Overdrive Arts, you still have access to your Super meter.  This can end up being your only option to extend combos while in Burnout, as well as your only option to defend against an incoming Drive Impact while cornered.  

### Avoiding Burnout
Though sometimes you’ll be in situations that force you into Burnout, there are usually ways to avoid it such as:

1. Using Drive Reversal *before* you have less than 2 bars left. 
2. Foregoing extra damage in a combo by not spending 2 bars on an OD Move. 
3. Using Drive Rush Cancel sparingly because 3 bars is fairly expensive. 
4. Using your Super Meter instead of an OD Move to finish a combo. 
5. Countering their Burnout-inducing Drive Impact with your own Drive Impact. 

In the heat of battle, these may be easier said than done, but with practice and awareness, you’ll gradually be able to reduce amount of time you spend in Burnout.
