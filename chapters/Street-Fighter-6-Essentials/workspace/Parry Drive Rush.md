# Understanding Parry Drive Rush in Street Fighter 6

## Parry Drive Rush Mechanics

Parry Drive Rush is another offensive tool in Street Fighter 6's drive system repertoire, and it looks similar to Drive Rush Cancel. 

It can be used to initiate offense as well as extend combos.

You perform the Parry Drive Rush by inputting a dash while holding down the parry (MP + MK together). This mechanic can be quite confusing due to its name and input, as it's not directly connected to the regular drive parry.

## Combo Extension with Parry Drive Rush

Let's take a closer look at how Parry Drive Rush is used as a combo extender.

In order to Parry Drive Rush, you have to hold parry (MP + MK together), and during the parry animation, input the dash (tap forward twice). This looks quite similar, if not exactly the same, as the Drive Rush Cancel.

However, it's different from Drive Rush Cancel because you're canceling the parry animation instead of a normal move. That means it can be executed in the middle of a combo as a means to close the gap through the dash and then extend the combo with a juggle.

### Example with Ryu

1.  Activate Denjin Mode with Down Down Punch
2.  Cr. MK into OD Donkey Kick (Wall Bounce)
3.  Quarter Circle Back Punch for the Palm (enemy pops up higher due to Denjin Mode)
4.  Parry Drive Rush
5.  Cr. HP, Heavy Donkey Kick

This combo does 27.05 damage at the cost of three bars: two for the OD Donkey Kick and one for the Parry Drive Rush.

Parry Drive Rush only costs one bar (or one-sixth of your drive gauge), which is 33% as much as Drive Rush Cancel, making it a more meter-efficient option for extending combos.

## Initiating Offense with Parry Drive Rush

Street Fighter IV players might find Parry Drive Rush reminiscent of Focus Attack Dash Cancel (FADC) used in that game. The input and usage are quite similar.

### Example with Ryu

1.  Parry Drive Rush
2.  Overhead (F+MP)

This combo changes the frame advantage of the overhead, making it +6 on hit and +1 on block. This allows you to combo into a standing medium punch, which can then be canceled into a special move or super, leading to significant damage off an overhead with Ryu.

This is a powerful tool in Street Fighter 6, making overheads and other moves more threatening with the Parry Drive Rush mechanic.

So those are the two main ways to use Parry Drive Rush in Street Fighter 6: as a combo extender and to initiate offense. It's a cost-efficient and versatile tool that adds depth to the game and allows for new combo possibilities.

### Transcript Attempt #2 
# Parry Drive Rush in Street Fighter 6

Parry Drive Rush is another offensive tool in the middle of the game.

Every character's Drive Rush is part of their drive system repertoire.

It looks similar to Drive Rush Cancel, in the sense that it can be used to initiate offense as well as extending combos.

You perform the Parry Drive Rush by inputting a dash while holding down the parry (medium punch plus medium kick together). This is definitely the mechanic that I found most confusing.

Admittedly, it's probably also the one that I know the least about. But I'm going to do my best.

## Why Parry Drive Rush is confusing

Part of the reason why I think this particular mechanic is confusing is because of its name and also its input.

As we'll cover later in more detail, the drive parry is a defensive mechanic that's similar to the parry in Street Fighter III Third Strike as well as the parry mechanic that some characters like Ryu and M. Bison have in Street Fighter V.

But that's where the similarities end, really, because the Parry Drive Rush, to my knowledge, can't be used defensively, at least not in the way that you would expect.

You might think that because the input is done starting with the parry, you can parry an attack and then Parry Drive Rush into a counter-attack. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work that way because when you do a regular drive parry, you don't get anywhere near the number of frames required for the Parry Drive Rush to connect.

It might be possible after a perfect parry, but at this point, it also doesn't even seem necessary because you have so much time when you hit a perfect parry that you wouldn't need to Parry Drive Rush.

The other reason why it's confusing is the input. Because of the name and the input, you think that it is somehow connected to the regular drive parry, but it's not.

## Using Parry Drive Rush as a combo extender

Let's take a closer look at how it's used as a combo extender.

First, we're going to examine the input. In order to Parry Drive Rush, you have to hold parry (meaning holding MP and MK together), and during the parry animation, which you can hold for an extended period of time, if you input the dash (meaning if you tap forward twice), then you get the Parry Drive Rush, which looks quite similar, if not exactly the same, as the Drive Rush Cancel.

But it's not the same as the Drive Rush Cancel because instead of canceling a normal into the Drive Rush, which results in a dash, in this case, you're canceling the parry animation instead. 

So that means it can be executed in the middle of a combo as a means to close the gap through the dash and then extend the combo with a juggle.

### Ryu Parry Drive Rush Combo Extension #1 
For example, if Ryu has "Denjin Mode" engaged by pressing "Down Down Punch", the palm gets a juggle potential boost. If you hit them with the palm while they're in the air, they'll stay in the air longer if you have Denjin Mode engaged.

The extra time they spend in the air gives you enough time to Parry Drive Rush, which moves you forward and then allows you to juggle with heavy punch or crouching heavy punch, which you can then cancel into a special, such as canceling into heavy kick, canceling into heavy donkey kick, or canceling into his level 3 super.

Here's the example:

After activating Denjin Mode with `D,D+Punch`, follow these steps to perform the combo:

1.  Land a cr. MK to start your combo. It's a solid low attack that can catch your opponent off-guard.
2.  Cancel the cr. MK into the Overdrive (OD) Donkey Kick by performing a QCF+KK. The OD version of Donkey Kick has a wall bounce property.
3.  After the wall bounce, your opponent will be in a juggle state. Perform the Palm (QCB+P) to juggle as they bounce off the wall.  Because Denjin is active, the Palm will keep your opponent airborne for a bit longer.
4.  Hold Parry (MP+MK), then dash (F, F) and release Parry to do the Parry Drive Rush.
5.  As your opponent is falling to the ground and the Parry Drive Rush carries you forward, press st. HP and cancel into HK Donkey Kick.

In summary, the combo sequence is: 
```
Activate Denjin > Crouching Medium Kick > OD Donkey Kick > Wall Bounce > Palm > Parry Drive Rush > Standing Heavy Punch > HK Donkey Kick
```

This deals *2,705 damage* at the cost of three of your Drive Gauge bars: two for the OD Donkey Kick and one for the Parry Drive Rush.

What makes Parry Drive Rush so interesting is its low cost compared to Drive Rush Cancel. 

Drive Rush Cancel costs three bars or half of your Drive Gauge, whereas Parry Drive Rush only costs one bar or one-sixth of your Drive Gauge. 

So it costs 33% as much as Drive Rush Cancel does.

This means that if you have the opportunity to extend a combo with it, it's almost always going to be worth it to spend one bar to do so. 

The only time it might not be worth it is if you only had one bar left. 

Other than that, it seems like it would always be worth it given the opportunity to extend the combo.

### Parry Drive Rush in Street Fighter 6 and Its Connection to Street Fighter IV

As a side note, Street Fighter IV players might find the Parry Drive Rush to be somewhat reminiscent of Focus Attack Dash Cancel (FADC) in Street Fighter IV. 

You could use the FADC to cancel special moves into a dash and extend the combo, and it was done with the same input - holding MP and MK together and then tapping forward twice. 

In Street Fighter IV, MP and MK were the commands for Focus Attack. Other than that, the input and its usage are pretty similar.

In Street Fighter IV, you could cancel a special move with FADC at the cost of two bars. 

FRyu could perform a MP FADC Ultra, which would allow him to cancel the DP into a dash and then juggle with the Ultra. 

Street Fighter 4 players will also remember that you could absorb a hit while charging the Focus Attack and then cancel the Focus Attack into a dash. And this tactic didn’t cost any meter at all.

This leads us to another way that you can use Parry Drive Rush, which is to initiate offense.

### Initiating Offense with Parry Drive Rush 

It wasn't until I had the frame data in front of me, thanks to fullmeter.com, that I was able to understand this mechanic. 

![[../../../../../__00-attachments/2023-04-08-08-32-42@2x.png]]

To better understand how Parry Drive Rush works, we need to look at the "after Drive Rush on hit" and "after Drive Rush on block" columns. 

When you parry Drive Rush and then press a button, the "after Drive Rush on hit" and "after Drive Rush on block" columns come into play. 

When you start offense this way, the frame advantage is the same as it is on the second hit after a Drive Rush Cancel.

Recall that in the earlier Drive Rush Cancel example, we started with `cr. MK xx Drive Rush Cancel, st. HP`.

![[../../../../../__00-attachments/2023-04-08-08-41-52.png|Source: fullmeter.com]]

The cr. MK is +11 off of a Drive Rush Cancel that hits, and the second move, st. HP, is +7 after Drive Rush on hit. 

If you perform a Parry Drive Rush followed by a st. HP and it hits, you'll be +7. If it's blocked, you'll be -3. 

This is because the `after Drive Rush on hit` and `after Drive Rush on block` columns are always +4 more than the regular on-hit and on-block columns.

## Extending Combos and Initiating Offense with Parry Drive Rush

In addition to extending combos by performing a Parry Drive Rush in the middle of a combo, the other way to use it is by initiating offense with it. 

The best example to illustrate why this is useful is with Ryu's Parry Drive Rush Overhead. 

First let’s take a closer look at the frame data of the Overhead.
![[2023-04-08-09-24-27 1.png|Source: fullmeter.com]]

1. F+MP is the input. 
2. Ryu's Overhead has a 20-frame `Startup` and, even though it only does 600 damage, it has to be blocked high. 
3. `On Block`, it's -3, which basically makes it unpunishable.
4. `On Hit`, it's +2. 

Being -3 On Block makes it essentially unpunishable because there are no three-frame normals or specials.  The fastest normals are four frames in SF6. 

Additionally, there are no invincible reversals that come out in less than five frames. So, -3 in this case means it's safe, but if they block it, it's the end of your turn.

![[../../../../../__00-attachments/2023-04-08-09-31-17.png]]

When using Parry Drive Rush into Overhead, the overhead leaves you +6 on hit and +1 on block. 

Being +6 on hit is good enough to combo into a st. MP, which has a 6-frame startup, or a cr. MP, which also has a 6-frame startup. 

Let's go with cr. MP for now, which does 700 damage instead of the 600 damage from st. MP.

With this example, you could perform a Parry Drive Rush Overhead and, if it connects, link into a cr. MP, cancel into a medium Donkey Kick, and then cancel that into Ryu's Level 3 Super, the Shin Shoryuken. 

This would deal 4580 damage, which is an absurd amount of damage to get off an overhead with Ryu. 

> [!note]
> In previous iterations of Street Fighter, such as 3rd Strike, Street Fighter IV, and Street Fighter V, it wasn't possible to get major damage off of an overhead with Ryu.
> 
> Typically, only a handful of characters like Dudley in 3rd Strike and Street Fighter IV, and maybe Urien in Street Fighter V, can convert an overhead into highly damaging supers. 

With Parry Drive Rush, even Guile becomes an offensive threat because his overhead gets enough frame advantage after Parry Drive Rush to link into his Standing MP, B+HP Target Combo, leading to big damage in the corner. 

There might be more ways to use Parry Drive Rush, but those are the two main ways that I'm aware of. 

And because it only costs one bar and you start with six, that means you could theoretically attempt six Parry Drive Rushes to try to get your offense going from the start of the round. 

It's probably not the best idea, as strong players won't let you get away with that. But it's likely the best deal, so to speak, in Street Fighter 6 because it only costs one bar and doesn’t require connecting with a normal like Drive Rush Cancel.

Drive Rush Cancel seems expensive by comparison and more limited because you have to make contact with the opponent in order for it to come out.  If they block, you may have just wasted half your Drive Gauge! 

Whereas with Parry Drive Rush, you can throw it out in the neutral game without needing to make contact, and it only costs one bar instead of three.  If they block, you’re only out one-sixth of your bar, instead of half. 

It also allows for new combo possibilities that didn't exist before, such as being able to connect your Level 3 Super from an Overhead in the corner.

Overall, this new mechanic enables characters like Ryu and Guile to deal significant damage off an overhead, which was not possible in previous games. 

Parry Drive Rush is not only cost-effective at just one bar, but it also opens up the potential for creative offensive strategies and gameplay for players to explore.
