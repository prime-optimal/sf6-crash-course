## Drive Reversal

Drive reversal is similar to the reversal or Alpha counter in Street Fighter V or the Alpha series. It's executed by tapping forward and drive impact (HP and HK) when you're in block stun. This move cancels the block stun and performs a horizontal lunging attack. If the opponent is hit, they're pushed back, knocked down, and incur Grey Life damage. Grey Life damage recovers slowly after a few seconds, but if you get hit before the Grey Life recovers, the damage becomes permanent. The cost for drive reversal is two drive gauge stocks.

Each character's drive reversal has different range, so you need to be aware of that. If you whiff, there's a chance it counts as a punish counter if you get hit. If the opponent blocks the drive reversal, you're only about -2 or -3 on block, meaning you're safe, but it's not your turn anymore.

If the drive reversal is parried, the defender can punish with a full combo. The startup frames for drive reversal seem to be similar to drive impact, but it cannot be baited out and thrown like the reversal in Street Fighter V.

## Drive Parry

Drive parry is similar to the parry in Street Fighter III: Third Strike or Street Fighter V, executed by pressing MP and MK together. The same input as V skill in Street Fighter V. It costs half a bar to attempt the parry, but if the parry is successful, you get the half bar back. To parry, press the input right as the attacker's move is making contact.

A successful parry absorbs the hit, and depending on the move, you may be able to counterattack. Unlike previous iterations, you can hold down the buttons to parry multiple hits. The parry window is six frames. If you get a perfect parry (when the move makes contact within the first two frames of the parry), the game slows down with a big animation effect and allows for a huge window of time to counterattack. However, with a regular parry, you don't get enough frame advantage for most moves to counterattack.

In Third Strike, parry was a high reward mechanic, but in Street Fighter V and VI, regular parry is not high reward, while perfect parry is high reward but also high risk due to startup and recovery frames. Wake-up parry isn't as strong as it was in Third Strike. The parry has a two-frame startup, which means if a meaty attack connects on the first two frames of the parry, the parry loses.

> Note: Need to clarify whether damage scaling starts at 50% for the entire combo after a perfect parry or if it decreases further with every hit.

Perfect parries are challenging even for experienced players. Perfect parry doesn't seem to benefit from the input buffering system like other inputs, which means it has to hit within the two-frame window. If the attack makes contact on frames 1 or 2, the parry loses; on frames 3 and 4, you get a perfect parry; on frames 5 through 8, you get a regular parry and likely won't be able to counterattack. After frame 8, you're in recovery frames, and if the opponent hits you, they get a punish counter and damage bonus.

Parries are effective in cross-up situations on wake-up since the parry will auto-correct. Note that you cannot parry when in burnout mode because you have no bar. If you parry a special move, you don't take any chip damage. Parrying a normal move doesn't decrease your drive gauge.
