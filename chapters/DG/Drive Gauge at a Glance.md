# Drive Gauge
## What is it?
Drive Gauge is a renewable resource that can be used offensively and defensively.  Both players start every round fully stocked with 6 bars, regardless of how much Drive Gauge they ended the previous round with. 

## Why is it important?
- You use Drive Gauge for offensive and defensive techniques. 
- Without it, you are extremely limited in offensive options and extremely vulnerable when on defense.  
- It doesn't carry over to the next round, therefore there's no point in saving it/dying with it.
- If you run out of Drive Gauge, you enter Burnout mode and can be dizzied. 

## How does it fit in with the big picture?
- In SFV, your EX moves and your Critical Art came used the same bar, meaning you would sometimes have to choose between being able to use your EX and doing a CA.  Now, they are separate.
- Since it refills each round, you don't need to worry about conserving it for the next round. 
- It can be used to extend combos ([[Drive Rush]]) put them in okizeme situations (Drive Rush), or as a counter ([[Drive Counter]])
- You lose Drive Gauge when you block, which penalizes overly defensive strategies.  

## What are some ways to use it
- OD (or EX) moves cost 2 bars
- Drive Rush costs 3 bars. 
- Parry Drive Rush costs 1 bar. 
- Drive Reversal costs 2 bars.  
- Drive Impact costs 1 bar.
- Parry attempts cost 0.5 bar

## How does it work?
1. You start each round with a full Drive Gauge (6 bars)
2. OD Special Moves do more damage and have different properties such as knockdown, juggle state, wall bounce, etc.
3. Combos can be extended with Drive Rush and Parry Drive Rush.
4. Offensive pressure can be initiated by canceling a Normal into Drive Rush or through Parry Drive Rush.

6. Drive Impact is similar to SF4â€™s Focus Attack, except it has two hits of armor.  
7. Drive Counter is similar to an Alpha Counter or V-Reversal, allowing the defender to push the attacker off. 
8. Each bar takes about five seconds to regenerate after it's used.  Blocking will stop the bar from regenerating, whereas walking forward will begin regenerating your bar.
