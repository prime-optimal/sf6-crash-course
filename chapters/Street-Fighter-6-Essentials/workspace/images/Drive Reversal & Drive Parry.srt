1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
Okay, so now let's talk about the defensive

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,920
system, the defensive options of the Drive System.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:26,440
So, I guess let's talk about Drive Reversal first because it's the most straightforward.

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:39,640
So, Drive Reversal is similar, if you played Street Fighter V or the Alpha series, it's

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:49,000
most similar to the reversal or Alpha counter.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:02,820
So it's done by tapping forward and Drive Impact, Heavy Punch and Heavy Kick when you're

7
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,180
in blockstun.

8
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,660
So this, so the move ends.

9
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:18,420
cancels the blockstun and then you do like a horizontal like lunging attack and

10
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:33,220
if the opponent gets hit then they're knocked they get pushed back pretty far

11
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:49,780
they're knocked down and they incur a Grey Life damage. So Grey Life damage is

12
00:01:49,780 --> 00:02:02,660
recovers slowly after a few seconds. But if you get hit,

13
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,560
while you're...

14
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:14,160
if you get hit again, or if you get hit before the Grey Life recovers,

15
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,660
that damage becomes permanent.

16
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,160
Uh...

17
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,360
I have to check and see if you can

18
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,360
throw them out of it.

19
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,340
If you can throw them out of the driver versa on reaction, or the driver versa on reaction,

20
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,140
but I don't think you can because that was one of the major problems with the

21
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,980
reversal in Street Fighter V is that if you bated it out, you could just throw them.

22
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,380
So there's that.

23
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:11,220
The other thing is that if it's, you can, it also, oh, oh, the cost is two of your drive

24
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,220
gauge stocks.

25
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:40,220
So you can't, you know, like, you can't use it like all the time.

26
00:03:40,220 --> 00:04:01,940
And it can be, yeah, like each character's Drive Reversal is different, is a little different

27
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:14,860
in terms of how much range it has. So you have to be conscious of that because like if

28
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:25,580
you throw it out when they're too far away then you whiff and I'm pretty sure if they

29
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:32,580
hit you it counts as a punish counter.

30
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:43,460
And if they block the driver reversal, it's the, I think you're only like minus 2 or minus

31
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:55,380
3. So you're safe if they block it, but it's

32
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,380
Not your turn anymore, but you don't get your turn back.

33
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:13,380
The other thing about

34
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:38,420
about a Drive Reversal is if it's parried, yeah, if the Drive Reversal is parried, the

35
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:59,740
Defender has enough time to punish, you know, you can go into a full combo if you parry

36
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:11,420
a Drive Reversal successfully. But I have to look at how many startup frames, but I want

37
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:26,100
to say it's pretty similar to Drive Impact. So it's theoretically something that you can

38
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:46,940
react to with a parry but you can't bait it out and throw them.

39
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,620
You might be, I'm pretty sure if you're close to them and you do it and you bait it out,

40
00:06:51,620 --> 00:07:02,180
I'm pretty sure you could also hold up and that would work too.

41
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,140
So that's driver or sole two bars of Drive Gauge stock.

42
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:15,500
So now, let's talk about the Drive Parry.

43
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:33,020
So if you played third strike or street fighter five, you're probably familiar with the parry.

44
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:40,900
It's done by pressing Medium Punch and Medium Kick together.

45
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:49,460
So the same input as V-Skill in Street Fighter V.

46
00:07:49,460 --> 00:08:02,180
So if you played Ryu in Street Fighter V, then it basically works the same way as it

47
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:11,260
did in that game, which is much different than the way that it worked in Third Strike, which

48
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:27,940
is you would have to tap forward. So it costs half a bar to

49
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:54,940
attempt the parry. But if the parry is successful, then you get the half bar back.

50
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:13,900
So, the way it works is you want to do the parry right as the move, as the attacker's

51
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,740
move is making contact.

52
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:37,620
And so yeah, if it connects, like if the parry is successful, then you don't take any damage

53
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,300
from the attack like it absorbs the hit

54
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,780
and

55
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,260
depending on the move

56
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,260
you

57
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,660
may

58
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,860
be able

59
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,060
to

60
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,220
um... to counter attack

61
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,740
and

62
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,300
uh...

63
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,900
i believe

64
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,260
you get a

65
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,660
i believe it'll count as uh...

66
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:12,660
a punish counter

67
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,820
i'm not totally sure

68
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,820
like what the window is i have to check

69
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,180
uh... the uh... okay so the other thing about

70
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,300
the parry

71
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,540
makes it

72
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,020
much different

73
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:45,620
from previous iterations is that you can just hold the buttons down to parry multiple hits

74
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:57,260
as opposed to needing to tap it with each hit that you're trying to parry.

75
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:11,460
So this makes parrying moves that hit multiple times super easy.

76
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:21,820
The other thing is that even though it, I feel like the window is six frames.

77
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,700
I think the window is six frames.

78
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:35,860
just say the Windows 6 frames. So within that 6 frame window where you where the

79
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:54,240
attack will be parried if you if it connects in the first like it if you

80
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:14,480
parry in that six-frame window if the move makes contact in the first two frames of the

81
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:26,480
parry then you get a Perfect Parry and you'll know that you got the Perfect Parry because the

82
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,720
game slows down and there's this big animation effect

83
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:44,720
kind of like the animation from hitting a Drive Impact successfully.

84
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,360
And

85
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:07,200
The Perfect Parry allows for a huge window of time to counter-attack.

86
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:15,760
It's probably as much time as you get from hitting a Drive Impact.

87
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:33,480
Whereas with a regular parry, for most moves,

88
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,920
you don't get enough frame advantage

89
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:47,440
from landing a successful parry in order to--

90
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
like you don't get enough frame advantage to counter attack.

91
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:02,840
So,

92
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,540
you know,

93
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,940
that kind of,

94
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:26,140
And to me that makes it like regular parry kind of weak.

95
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:37,760
Because in Third Strike, you know, you could...

96
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:54,280
Like, in third strike usually, um, in third strike if you got a parry, if you parried

97
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:04,320
like a medium or heavy attack, that was usually, um, that would usually give you enough time

98
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:15,680
to counterattack with like, you know, whatever your characters main, you know, combo starter was.

99
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:30,240
And, you know, that basically, oh, and even on a light attack, if you parried a light up close,

100
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:42,000
you still had enough time to be able to throw the attacker.

101
00:15:42,000 --> 00:16:02,880
So, you know, what that resulted in was the parry being like a very high reward mechanic in Third Strike.

102
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:18,180
It's Street Fighter V. You know, regular parry isn't, you know, isn't high reward, but

103
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,800
definitely the Perfect Parry is high reward.

104
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:37,960
But it's also high risk because just like in Street Fighter V, the parry has both startup

105
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,800
frames and recovery frames.

106
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:52,360
Whereas in Third Strike, there basically were no startup frames.

107
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,760
So you could do a parry on wake up.

108
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:06,880
And because you're just tapping forward,

109
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,320
if the opponent wasn't attacking,

110
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:18,040
then there was no recovery animation,

111
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,040
because you just tapped forward and nothing happened.

112
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,940
But starting in Street Fighter V

113
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,040
and now coming into Street Fighter VI,

114
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,040
there are startup frames and recovery frames

115
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,640
on the parry, which means if the attacker

116
00:17:39,640 --> 00:18:00,880
If an attacker is doing, if an attacker has, if an attacker is timing, if the opponent

117
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:24,680
is timing the attack, is timing a meaty attack to hit you right as you're getting up. The

118
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:45,520
meaty attack wins because the parry has a two frame startup. So that means that you can't

119
00:18:45,520 --> 00:19:02,300
You can do the parry on wake up, but if the meaty attack connects on the first two frames

120
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:26,540
of the parry, the parry loses. So like, you know, like, that may not sound like, like,

121
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:34,940
I would say it's too early to tell whether or not Wake Up Parry is going to be something

122
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,420
that is a reliable option on Wake Up.

123
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:55,940
But I don't think it will be because it's basically designed not to be an omniscient

124
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:05,140
or a um it's not supposed to be a strong wake-up option because in third strike it was arguably

125
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:18,580
too strong of a wake-up option and in that game you always had to worry about wake-up parry because

126
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,100
Because let's say if you were fighting a character like Juri with like

127
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,660
unblockables or like super high damage output, you know,

128
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:40,980
the, you know, the defender can have, you know,

129
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:50,020
you could be losing the entire round and then get one lucky wake-up parry

130
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:59,940
and then totally, um, you know, switch totally switch the momentum up and

131
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:11,300
you know, do a, you know, do like game changing damage, do like, yeah, do game changing damage

132
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,820
off of parrying one low light attack.

133
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:39,460
You know, so I think they've basically toned down how good it is on wake up to prevent

134
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,500
those situations.

135
00:21:41,500 --> 00:22:10,540
The other thing about Perfect Parry is that you can't...

136
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:24,620
If you get a Perfect Parry, the damage scaling starts at 50%.

137
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:34,060
So I don't know if that's like the entire combo is just 50% damage scaling or it starts

138
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,340
at 50% and goes lower with every hit that I don't know.

139
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:52,940
I have to check, but it's significant that the damage is reduced.

140
00:22:52,940 --> 00:23:15,340
and also like even as a dirt strike player with years of parrying experience, I find

141
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:41,020
whoa I find perfect parries to be really is really difficult. It's also worth mentioning.

142
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,020
I haven't tested this myself.

143
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Well, okay.

144
00:23:46,020 --> 00:24:00,020
It's worth noting that it appears like the Perfect Parry can't be done.

145
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,680
Like, you have to...

146
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,620
The move has to make contact in those first...

147
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,120
Not only does the move have to make contact...

148
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,220
Or...

149
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,720
In those first two frames...

150
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,120
But like...

151
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,820
It appears like it doesn't benefit from the...

152
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:41,160
It doesn't benefit from the input buffering system like other inputs do.

153
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:47,640
For example, in Street Fighter V,

154
00:24:50,760 --> 00:25:00,520
Street Fighter V introduced either, I think it was a three-frame buffer, where you could,

155
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:15,080
you could do a move like up to three or five frames early, and the game would just

156
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:34,680
register it as coming out on the earliest possible frame, which made Link combos much,

157
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,680
much easier to the point, to the level of...

158
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:51,680
It basically makes it so that one frame links

159
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,920
aren't actually one frame because you had,

160
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,880
because you could input the next hit of the console,

161
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,440
the next hit of the combo up to three frames earlier or five frames and it would still

162
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:21,000
and the game would count it as having, you know, come out on the first possible frame.

163
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:35,240
Whereas in Street Fighter IV, one-frame links really were one-frame links.

164
00:26:35,240 --> 00:27:01,840
though the planking technique was discovered which allowed which basically lets you generate

165
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,840
extra inputs to make those one-frame links easier to do.

166
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:18,680
So what does it mean that the parry doesn't benefit from the...

167
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:26,760
What does it mean that you can't input buffer the Perfect Parry?

168
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:40,500
Well that means that it actually has to hit on, it actually has to hit in that two frame

169
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:49,920
window.

170
00:27:49,920 --> 00:28:11,680
Otherwise, you get a regular parry and most likely you won't be able to punish the move.

171
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:26,480
So I'm pretty sure that means that because the parry has a two frame startup, you only

172
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:36,640
have, you can only get the Perfect Parry on frames three and four.

173
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:52,640
And there's no input buffering, so you literally had a window of...

174
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:00,640
You have a one-thirtieth of a second window to hit the Perfect Parry.

175
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,140
And so if you hit it too...

176
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:15,620
Yeah, like the the attackers move has to collide

177
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:23,260
with the parry on frames three or four in order to get the Perfect Parry. If it's

178
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:29,060
the four frame three the parry loses because it's

179
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,340
still in the startup frames and

180
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,740
if it's

181
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:43,020
And if it's after and if it's the fourth

182
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:48,180
If it's the fourth

183
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,900
Sorry if it's the

184
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,780
Fifth

185
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:03,720
Okay, yeah, if it hits on...

186
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,660
Okay, let's start over.

187
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:19,900
If it hits, if the attack makes contact on frames one or two, the parry loses.

188
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:32,900
On frames 3 and 4 you get a Perfect Parry and then on frames 5 through 8 you get a regular

189
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:41,780
parry and likely won't be able to counter attack with anything.

190
00:30:41,780 --> 00:31:04,020
But after frame 8, you're in recovery frames, which means that if the opponent hits you,

191
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:13,820
score a... they'll get the punish counter frame and damage bonus.

192
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,820
So, um...

193
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:26,820
Yeah, I mean...

194
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:45,020
I don't know. Me personally, I guess I haven't trained parries enough to feel like I'm a threat with them.

195
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:55,020
Because it just seems so daunting to...

196
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:05,020
It's like the risk reward is not...

197
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:13,020
Like the risk is really high and the reward is pretty low.

198
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,300
low even if you get the Perfect Parry there's still the 50% damage scaling.

199
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:34,940
But one way that it is that it does seem to be one situation that it does seem to be

200
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:46,700
like pretty effective in is in a cross-up situation on wake-up. So if the opponent is trying to

201
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,260
if you're knocked down and the opponent goes for the cross-up,

202
00:32:51,260 --> 00:33:01,740
going for the parry is probably a pretty good option because

203
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,780
Like, it doesn't...

204
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Like, the parry will...

205
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,780
The parry will auto-correct.

206
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,780
So you don't need to...

207
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:22,780
You don't need to worry about blocking the opposite way.

208
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,780
And if you get the Perfect Parry...

209
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,780
Then...

210
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:41,420
Yeah, you have enough time to counter attack.

211
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:50,860
The other thing to note is that you cannot parry when you're in burnout mode because

212
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,940
you have no bar.

213
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:08,060
Yeah, can't parry when you're in burnout.

214
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:27,860
Oh, and I guess it's also worth mentioning that you don't...

215
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:37,340
If you parry a special move, you don't take any chip damage.

216
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:51,500
parry a normal it doesn't decrease your Drive Gauge so that's parries
