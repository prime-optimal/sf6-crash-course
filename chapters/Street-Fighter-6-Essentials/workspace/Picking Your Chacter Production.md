### Transcript 
Okay, so now we're going to talk about choosing using a character.

[silence] [ Pause ] My first year of college, I saw a video of Urien.

It was a combo video by John D.

Rockefeller.

This was the pre-YouTube era.

I think it was somebody that lived on my floor that showed it to me.

But in this video, I saw Yuri and Dew some of the sickest combos I'd ever seen in a fighting game.

And I was playing a bunch of different fighting games at that time, but that was the video that basically inspired me to become a serious competitive third strike player.

So I know how it feels to see something really cool and then instantly want to play it.

I get it.

But here's the thing.

Just because something's cool doesn't mean that it's strong or practical to learn quickly Or Or that you should immediately try to play it.

Try to play as that character.



Now why is that.

Now why is that.

Now why is that.

So there's a couple of different reasons.

First, they built a game around him.

He's on the cover of every single game.

He is basically averaged average at everything.

He's not super fast.

He's not super slow.

He doesn't do a ton of damage, but he doesn't, but he does a decent amount of damage.

He has like a very straightforward ways to take advantage of all the systems in the game, which makes it easier to learn because every move that he has that uses one of the different mechanics is going to be useful in some way.

[silence] So in the beginning of Street Fighter V, Ryu was really strong.

And it seems like in Street Fighter VI, at least at the beginning, Ryu's pretty strong because he's able to get a lot of damage in all kinds of different meter situations.

So for me personally, I pick Ryu at the start of the game to learn the game through Ryu.

I think it's a really good starting point for me personally.

But I, you know, I don't expect to stick with him for the entire duration of the game.

I do think he has a good starting point because you don't have to.

.

.

If you already have basic knowledge of Ryu, then it just.

.

.

There's less that you need to learn at once, because if you've played them in other games, you understand the basics of, you know, his fireball and DP.

So that means you can just focus on.

.

.

you can focus your mind more on the other stuff like learning the, mechanics, the new system mechanics of the game.

However, now, um, I would, I would say that, oh, okay.

I guess before getting into that, um, you know, a lot of people don't want to play Ryu because they think he's boring or because like quote unquote everybody plays Ryu.

But to me, I care less about that and I care more about winning and being effective.

know, but to each their own.

So even though Ryu was on the cover of every, was basically like, you know, on the cover of every Street Fighter up until now, because now who's the cover boy.

Luke.

And it's okay that Luke is, you know, the poster boy, but I think he's now a viable option to start the game with as well.

because he was in Street Fighter V, right.

He was added as the last character, the last DLC character.

And now So [Silence] He's on the cover.

So a lot of people didn't like him in Street Fighter 5 because you know, they felt like he was too strong.

And I think that was kind of the point.

He's super strong in Street Fighter 5 and he's on the cover of Street Fighter 6.

Street Fighter VI.

So to me, it seems like they're trying to reward Luke players.

Okay, first off, like he's really strong in Street Fighter V.

So if you play him and he's super strong in V and then they put him on the cover of VI, you know, of course you're gonna play him.

They're not going to do that and then make him suck because they want people to buy the game and play the game and enjoy the game.

So there's no, like they're not gonna sucker you into playing a shitty character.

So, you know, I also think his design is meant to be annoying.

To me, he's like the character that I'm talking about the character that little brothers should play.

Because he is strong, his stuff is easy to do from an execution perspective.

[ Pause ] [silence] (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) So the way I think about him is like Like he's Shoto version 2.

0.

So I think it is.

Oh, and also thinking about how strong he was in five.

I think it's worth playing him.

Okay.

so strong in five, and I think there's a good chance he's strong in six, that you're either, in order to give yourself the best chance of success, you're either going to need to use him yourself or you're going to need to learn how to fight him.

And as we know, the best way to understand how to fight a character is to use that character yourself.

bonus, if you learned Reversed, you could easily learn Luke next and vice versa because his special moves share the same inputs.

And in my opinion, it's really helpful when characters share the same inputs.

Because it speeds up the learning process.

Because you have to learn less of the muscle memory in order to gain competence or rather reach competency.

Okay.

[ Silence ].
