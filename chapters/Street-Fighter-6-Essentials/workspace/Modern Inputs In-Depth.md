Okay, so let's go through modern controls.

So there's, instead of having three punches and three kicks with light medium and heavy versions of each, you have just light medium and heavy attacks.

or when you're in the game and you're in modern, then it would be blue, yellow, and red.

[ Pause ] So with Ryu, standing light is the same as classic, but his crouching light will give him crouching heavy kick.

Unless you do it twice, because the light attacks can chain into each other, and then he'll get a crouching light kick followed by a light punch.

And for medium, his medium attack, standing is his standing medium punch.

And then if you're crouching, you'll get his medium kick.

And then heavy gets his heavy attack or his heavy punch down heavy gets him crouching heavy.

you would expect.

But if you press forward and medium punch, then he'll get, he does the overhead and if you press forward and heavy he gets the hopkick but if you press down forward heavy, then he gets the sweep or crouching heavy kick.

And back heavy gets him the axe kick.

Yeah.

Seems to be the main difference.

[ Silence ] Okay.

So, all right.

So, it has light, medium, heavy, and then, so with in modern mode, the light.

Okay.

So those are the light medium and heavy buttons.

So, you know, experienced players might say, well, this is definitely inferior to playing on classic and you know because you can't access all of his moves.

But I guess this is where it gets a slightly more interesting.

So the auto button or assist, the auto or assist button kind of acts like a shift key on a keyboard.

So if you hold auto and press light, then he gets standing light kick.

And if you're crouching, that will automatically stand him up because, um, yeah, I don't know, that's just how it works.

And with medium, if you hold auto and press medium, then he gets a, he gets the crashing medium punch.

And if If you hold auto and heavy, then he gets the forward heavy punch, solar plexus strike.

And it seems like he gets that no matter what.

Yeah, okay.

In the air, if you jump light, then he gets his jumping light kick.

Medium gets the jumping heavy kick and heavy gets jump heavy punch.

If you hold auto, then, oh yeah, okay, I see.

So there's no difference.

Okay, I see.

So in the air, he is missing the jumping medium punch, which juggles.

Yeah.

And.

.

.

Yeah, there doesn't seem to be much more than that.

Okay.

So now we'll move on to the special button.

So the big thing about modern is that you have access to one button specials, which, you know, reduces the execution barrier significantly.

So for example, with Ryu, if you just press neutral special, then he gets a heavy, sorry, he gets a medium fireball.

Forward special gives him the DP and back special gets him the Tatsu and down special gets in the donkey kick, all of them being the medium versions.

But if you, but you can still access the different strengths of the moves by doing the full motion and hitting the button that hitting the strength that you want.

So one button special gets you medium every time.

But if you do, let's say you wanted a heavy fire, a heavy fireball, then you would do the fireball motion and then press heavy and then boom, you get the heavy, yeah, you get the heavy button.

Or sorry, you get the the heavy fireball.

So by default, you also have the Perry button.

I, yeah.

So you have a one button perry.

Side note, I mean, as a hitbox and stick player, I always have perry set to one button anyways.

And the same thing with drive impact.

So he He also has a button, by default, he has a button for drive impact as well.

So oh, actually, so I forgot to mention.

So to do the OD version of a special move, you press special and auto at the same time.

Or you can also do the EX by pressing two buttons when you do the motion manually.

So yeah, that's the same.

So then by default you also get a throw button which is done by pressing light and medium together.

You don't need, if for some reason you wanted to reassign that button to something else, you could do that because you could still press light and medium together manually and the throw will still come out.

But I don't think it's possible to do that with the Perry.

So as As far as I can tell, you actually need to keep the Perry button.

So, hey, Siri, stop.

Okay.

So now the heavy, sorry, the, so thinking, so digging into the auto button a little bit more.

If you're holding auto and you press special, then you get the EX version of the special move.

But it also leads to auto combos or assisted combos as they're called in the game.

So it seems like each character has three auto combos.

And so if you're, so for example, with Ryu, if you hold auto and then press light twice, you get the standing light kick into Donkey Kick.

And if you press medium, if you hold auto and then press medium twice, then he'll do the EX-POM.

And if you press it a third time, then it'll combo into his Level 2 super and his third auto combo Oh, that's interesting Oh, yeah, okay.

So if you aren't holding medium punch, or sorry, if you aren't holding auto and you just press medium punch, then he does three times.

If you press medium punch three times, then he does his target combo.

Or sorry, the first target combo, the medium punch, light kick, heavy kick target combo.

If you press heavy punch twice, you'll get his heavy kick target combo.

But if you're holding auto while you do the.

.

.

If you hold auto and hit medium twice, then he'll do the crouching medium punch into the EX palm.

And if you press it a third time, then he gets the level 2 super.

And if you hold auto and press heavy, you can, it'll do the solar plexus into crouching medium punch and cancel that into the EX fireball and then cancel that into his level the three.

So that's pretty interesting.

The other thing to note about the auto button is that you don't have to hold it.

You can also just tap it.

You can tap the two buttons together and it does the same thing.

So, you know, some players might find that easier.

I personally find that easier than trying to hold it and do stuff, but, you know, I think it also is gonna depend on what controller you're playing on.

It's also, okay.

So when you do the auto, if you press special and auto, you get the OD version of the move.

But if you're holding special, okay.

actually forget that.

Okay, so now let's talk about how you do the supers.

So when you're in modern mode, instead of needing to do like the complex super motions, like for example, with Ryu, you would do, you know, two fireball motions and then press punch, instead you press heavy and special at the same time.

And so if you press it at the same time while you're neutral, then you get the level one, if you press back, uh, heavy and special, you get level two.

And if you press down special and heavy, you get level three.

And so this works.

Oh yeah, that's interesting.

Yeah, so you can either press the two buttons together or another thing that you might want to try is to set one of the buttons to set one of the buttons to special and heavy.

And that gets you one button supers, which is definitely going to be faster and easier than doing the full, you know, motions.

But you can do the full, you can do the motion, the full motions for the super as well.

So there might be situations where you punish moves on reaction with a one button super.

But if you put the time into practicing, then it would be better to do the better to do the supers, better to do the full inputs for the supers.

And I I guess side note, one of the perks or one of the interesting things about modern mode is that because you can do the inputs for the specials and supers, either using the special button or by doing the manual input, it allows you to do it allows you to kind of it allows you to progress at your own pace.

Because instead of needing to, let's say, front load the investment of time to do everything manually like you would in Classic, you can just learn as you go over time.

is let's say, like Ryu has four different special moves, and then the three different strengths for each.

Well, I guess technically four, if you count the OD versions.

Right.

So you might-- when you first are learning the game, you might use a special button for everything.

But over time, you might build the muscle memory for each special move individually over time, and then add those, add doing the inputs to your repertoire gradually over time instead of needing to make that huge investment of time upfront.

So I personally think that that's a really good option for new players.

And I also think even for experienced players, I think using learning a new character with modern mode is probably going to be way more efficient because if you don't know how to play the character, you can learn much faster with modern mode.

And then, even if you are experienced, once you kind of get the hang of the character, then you can learn the different combos and inputs over time.

then you can learn the different combos and inputs over time.

So, okay, and I guess finally the other thing to note is that while you're holding the auto button.

If you press, if you have one of your buttons set to special and heavy, holding the auto button will prevent the super from coming out and you'll get a EX instead.

[ Pause ] [ Writing on Board ] [ Pause ] [ Writing on Board ] [ Pause ] [ Writing on Board ] [ Silence ] [tapping] (tapping) [ Writing on Board ] Okay.

So it's also worth noting that even though they the characters have the auto combos, All of the moves still retain the same properties that they have in classic mode.

So for example, reuse, actually a better example is Luke's crouching medium punch in classic mode is like his, you know, one of his best buttons.

And so you can still use that, you can still use all the special moves and cancel into, or sorry, you can still use the normals and cancel into the special moves.

just instead of having to do the full input, you can just press the special button and it'll come out.

And so, you know, like, I guess an advanced technique with modern mode is to have one of your button set to heavy and special so that you have one button supers and then you can throw out normals that are cancelable from a distance like so that so so that they aren't blocked by the opponent.

you can basically buffer the input of the super while you're throwing out the normal.

And if it doesn't make contact with the opponent, then your super is not gonna come out.

But if it does make contact, then the super comes out.

So you can, you know, if your neutral is good, you can throw it out.

And, you know, if you happen to whiff punish a stray button, a stray normal of theirs, then it'll automatically do the super, but if it doesn't make contact, then nothing will come out.

But if it makes contact and they block, then your super is gonna come out.

So overall, I think a lot of players will instantly dismiss modern mode until they get beat by somebody using it.

Until they get beat by somebody using it.

You know, I mean, you know, as an experienced, you know, as like a lifelong street fighter player, I can definitely understand why there's a lot of people that don't like it.

me personally, I think it's mostly geared towards keeping people engaged and playing after the hype of the game.

Dies down.

Most people don't necessarily want to spend all their time in training mode, working on building the muscle memory for combos.

And I totally get why most people don't want to do that.

I think as a whole, anything that you can do to keep more casual players engaged and playing the game, you know, I think overall it's a good thing.

But I do think that, you know, there is some potential for experienced competitive players to potentially use and abuse modern mode, especially because of one button supers.

So, you know, it kind of remains to be seen whether the damage scaling, you know, is makes it, you know, not It makes it.

.

.

Whether the damage scaling for using the special button is not worth being able to you know, hit supers on reaction and kind of not need to think about your.

.

.

Like you don't need to spend hardly any time working on combos and instead, you know, the game becomes more about decision making because taking the damage scaling into account, the the trade off for not needing to spend so much time building the muscle memory and perfecting your combos is that you're you have to make more correct or you the no sorry the trade off for not needing to spend so much time working on your execution is that the number of correct decisions that you need to make in every round in order to win increases.

So to me, you know, it's, you know, I think that players are just going to have to make their choice on what they prefer.

You know, do they want to spend the time to build the muscle memory to get an extra, let's say damage boost of 20% or, you know, do they just want to like, you know, push buttons, have fun.

Or let's say spend their time trying to better understand character match ups and making the right decisions, you know, it's, it's a choice.

And only time will tell.

Only time will tell if there's truly a right or wrong answer.

(buzzing).

Okay, so let's go through modern controls.

Instead of having three punches and three kicks with light, medium, and heavy versions of each, you have just light, medium, and heavy attacks. Or when you're in the game and you're in modern mode, then it would be blue, yellow, and red.

With Ryu, standing light is the same as classic, but his crouching light will give him crouching heavy kick. Unless you do it twice, because the light attacks can chain into each other, and then he'll get a crouching light kick followed by a light punch.

For medium, his medium attack standing is his standing medium punch. And then if you're crouching, you'll get his medium kick. And then heavy gets his heavy attack, or his heavy punch; down heavy gets him crouching heavy.

But if you press forward and medium punch, then he'll do the overhead; and if you press forward and heavy, he gets the hopkick; but if you press down forward heavy, then he gets the sweep or crouching heavy kick. And back heavy gets him the axe kick.

> Verify the controls and moves of Ryu in modern mode.

Experienced players might say this is definitely inferior to playing on classic because you can't access all of his moves. But this is where it gets slightly more interesting. The auto or assist button kind of acts like a shift key on a keyboard.

So if you hold auto and press light, then he gets standing light kick. And if you're crouching, that will automatically stand him up. With medium, if you hold auto and press medium, then he gets the crouching medium punch. And if you hold auto and press heavy, then he gets the forward heavy punch, solar plexus strike.

In the air, if you jump light, then he gets his jumping light kick. Medium gets the jumping heavy kick and heavy gets jump heavy punch. If you hold auto, then, oh yeah, okay, I see. So there's no difference.

> Double-check the difference when holding auto in the air.

Now we'll move on to the special button. The big thing about modern mode is that you have access to one-button specials, which reduces the execution barrier significantly. So for example, with Ryu, if you just press neutral special, then he gets a medium fireball. Forward special gives him the DP, and back special gets him the Tatsu; down special gets the donkey kick, all of them being the medium versions.

But you can still access the different strengths of the moves by doing the full motion and hitting the button that corresponds to the strength you want. So one-button special gets you medium every time. But if you do, let's say you wanted a heavy fireball, then you would do the fireball motion and then press heavy, and then boom, you get the heavy fireball.

By default, you also have the parry button. As a hitbox and stick player, I always have parry set to one button anyway. And the same thing with drive impact. He also has a button for drive impact by default.

To do the OD version of a special move, you press special and auto at the same time. Or you can also do the EX by pressing two buttons when you do the motion manually.

By default, you also get a throw button which is done by pressing light and medium together. You can still press light and medium together manually, and the throw will still come out.

The auto button also leads to auto combos or assisted combos, as they're called in the game. So it seems like each character has three auto combos. For example, with Ryu:

1. Hold auto and press light, medium, or heavy

Holding auto and pressing light, medium, or heavy attacks will result in different outcomes:

- Hold auto and press light: Ryu will perform a standing light kick. If you're crouching, this will automatically make him stand up.
- Hold auto and press medium: Ryu will perform a crouching medium punch.
- Hold auto and press heavy: Ryu will perform a forward heavy punch (solar plexus strike).

In the air, Ryu's attacks are as follows:

- Jump light: Jumping light kick
- Jump medium: Jumping heavy kick
- Jump heavy: Jumping heavy punch

There's no difference when holding auto for these air attacks, and he is missing the jumping medium punch, which juggles.

2. One button specials and supers

In modern mode, players can perform one button specials and supers, significantly reducing the execution barrier. For Ryu, neutral special results in a medium fireball, forward special gives a DP, back special gives a Tatsu, and down special gives a donkey kick (all medium versions). However, different strengths of moves can still be accessed by performing the full motion and pressing the desired strength button.

One button supers can be done by pressing heavy and special at the same time. Pressing these buttons in different directions will result in different super levels (neutral for level 1, back for level 2, and down for level 3). Setting one of the buttons to special and heavy allows for one button supers, which can be faster and easier than performing full motions.

3. Auto combos

Holding auto and pressing certain buttons will lead to auto combos or assisted combos:

- Hold auto and press light twice: Standing light kick into Donkey Kick
- Hold auto and press medium twice: EX-POM; press a third time to combo into Level 2 super
- Hold auto and press heavy: Solar plexus into crouching medium punch, cancel into EX fireball, and cancel into Level 3 super

Players can tap the two buttons together instead of holding auto for the same result. Holding auto and pressing special results in the OD version of the move.

4. Damage scaling and decision making

Modern mode's damage scaling might make it less appealing for some players, but the trade-off is that it reduces the need to spend time building muscle memory and perfecting combos. Instead, players can focus on character matchups and making correct decisions during gameplay. It's up to each player to decide which approach they prefer.
