Okay, so now we're going to talk about Modern Controls versus classic controls.

So what is the difference between modern and classic?

So Modern Controls are a brand new control scheme that reduces the damage output of some

moves in exchange for significantly easier inputs on Specials and Supers.

So for example, you can do one button Specials, such as reuse Fireball or DP, which makes

it a lot easier for newer and casual players to, you know, to have fun with the game.

So rather than doing, rather than needing to practice a down, down forward, forward

and punch motion for a Fireball, Ryu can just press neutral special and the Fireball will

come out.

So why is this important?

Well, when you lower the execution barrier, you know, it has the potential to change quite

a lot.

You know, as somebody who's played in the arcade since I was a kid, I can tell you I've spent

countless hours practicing special moves, combos, you name it so that I could, you know,

hit these moves in real matches in high pressure situations.

But obviously, the vast majority of players aren't going to invest the time that it takes

to be dedicated enough to build the muscle memory required to, you know, play fighting

games at a high level, for the most part.

Obviously there's people that do, there's people that will dedicate that time, you know,

But of course that's a smaller, that's a really small number of people compared to the overall

size of the player base.

Obviously, I have no way to know what those numbers are, but Capcom might know.

For all we know, they have really good analytics on how long people play as in how many hours

They stick with it after they first start playing on Steam or console.

You know, and it is hard to,

you know, I mean, I can't argue and say that, you know, it's not,

Uh, it's not like that's going to, I, it's not like it's going to stop.

People from playing or it's not like, um,

It's not like they're going to have more players give up because of the existence of Modern Controls.

And anybody who does give up is going to be somebody who

was playing on classic controls their entire life and now is insulted that

Somebody can just pick up a controller, press two buttons,

and get a super.

I can definitely envision a scenario

where a lot of veteran players

are really disgusted or indignant or angry

that all the time that they have spent over the years

is arguably no longer necessary.

And who knows, I might end up,

I might end up being one of those players.

It's too early to say.

And, you know, I guess side note, you know, we've,

you know, there's definitely fighting games

with lower barriers to execution,

where people can just mash buttons and stuff happens.

And, you know, for casual players,

that's fun and that's fine.

You know, obviously I'm most concerned

with, you know, serious players

and the competitive side of things.

But that's also one of the things that makes

Modern Controls kind of a wild card

because it's too early to tell what the real impact

is gonna be on the competitive landscape.

Initially, I think a lot of people were under the impression

that there was a 20% damage reduction

for using Modern Controls.

Myself included, that's what I thought it was just

that way across the board.

But now, since the demo has been out for a few days,

it's not that cut and dry.

[ Silence ]

So today, there was an image posted by FGC Daily on Reddit.

And this image shows the damage-- it looks like the damage from Luke's Level 2.

And it compares the damage between classic modern doing the motion of the super and modern

using the shortcut. And it turns out that the damage on classic and modern when you do

do the motion is exactly the same.

On.

But when.

You're in, but if you use the shortcut in Modern Controls then.

The.

The super looks like it does,

yeah, I mean, I guess it looks like it does about 20% less.

I'm not totally sure if there's a difference

between doing 20% less damage

and starting the damage scaling at 80%.

percent. But it's not super, it's not way less. It's not.

It's not the damage reduction from using the shortcut while in modern.

It's not low enough that you wouldn't, it's not so low that it's not so low that you could

immediately write it off and say that it's not worth it.

But I think the real...

I think the more important point is that

you're using Modern Controls, you have the option to do the motion for the Specials and

the Supers, but you also have the option to use the shortcuts.

So,

you know, that's like an added layer of utility that,

utility that, you know, it didn't exist before.

So that makes it not very clear cut as to how effective or ineffective it'll be in long run.

run.

[ Pause ]

(Silence)

But in exchange for this flexibility, there are some consequences.

So for example, Luke doesn't have, when he's in Modern Controls, he doesn't have access

to his back Heavy Kick, which is his most damaging punish counter normal after blocking

a DP or another high risk reversal.

So now, yeah, let's take a closer look at what the differences are with the inputs.

Now, let's take a closer look at what the differences are with the inputs. In Classic Controls, players need to execute precise joystick movements and button presses to perform Specials and Supers. This demands a higher level of execution and muscle memory, which can be a barrier for newer or casual players.

On the other hand, Modern Controls simplify these inputs, allowing players to perform moves with fewer and easier button presses. This lowers the execution barrier and makes the game more accessible to a wider audience. However, this simplified control scheme may be seen as a disadvantage by some veteran players, who have spent years honing their skills with Classic Controls.

In conclusion, the introduction of Modern Controls in Street Fighter 6 has the potential to change the competitive landscape of the game. While it makes the game more accessible to newcomers, it may also create some tension among veteran players who feel their time spent mastering the Classic Controls is now less valuable. It remains to be seen how the game's competitive community will adapt to these changes and whether Modern Controls will become a widely accepted feature or remain a point of contention.

# Classic Controls vs. Modern Controls in Street Fighter 6

## Introduction
In Street Fighter 6, there are two control schemes to choose from: Classic Controls and Modern Controls. The main difference between these schemes is the complexity of inputs required for executing moves. Let's discuss the implications of these two control schemes on the player base and the game's competitive scene.

## Classic Controls
Classic Controls involve precise joystick movements and button presses, which have been the norm in fighting games for years. This control scheme serves as a barrier for newer or casual players who may struggle with the execution difficulty. Veterans who have spent countless hours mastering these controls may feel a sense of accomplishment and respect for their dedication.

## Modern Controls
Modern Controls, on the other hand, offer a more accessible option for new players. With simplified inputs for Specials and Supers, the execution difficulty is significantly lower. This control scheme requires less muscle memory, making it easier for newcomers to pick up the game.

The flexibility of Modern Controls allows players to use both motion inputs and shortcuts, adding a layer of utility not seen before in the series. However, there are some trade-offs. For example, Luke doesn't have access to his back Heavy Kick, which is his most damaging punish counter normal after blocking a DP or another high-risk reversal.

## Impact on Competitive Scene
It's too early to tell what the real impact of Modern Controls will be on the competitive landscape. Initially, many people thought there was a 20% damage reduction when using Modern Controls, but further investigation has shown that it's not that simple. The damage output depends on whether a player uses motion inputs or shortcuts, with the latter resulting in slightly lower damage.

Veteran players may feel disgruntled by the introduction of Modern Controls, as they believe the time spent mastering Classic Controls is now less relevant. However, it's worth noting that the long-term effects of Modern Controls on the competitive scene remain unclear.

## Conclusion
While Classic Controls have been the standard for fighting games, Modern Controls offer an interesting alternative that may encourage more players to pick up the game. The impact on the competitive scene is yet to be determined, but this new control scheme certainly adds another dimension to Street Fighter 6.
