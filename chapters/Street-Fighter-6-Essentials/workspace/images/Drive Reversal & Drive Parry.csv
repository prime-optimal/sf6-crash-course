00:00,000;00:08,820;"Okay, so now let's talk about the defensive"
00:08,820;00:14,920;"system, the defensive options of the Drive System."
00:14,920;00:26,440;"So, I guess let's talk about Drive Reversal first because it's the most straightforward."
00:26,440;00:39,640;"So, Drive Reversal is similar, if you played Street Fighter V or the Alpha series, it's"
00:39,640;00:49,000;"most similar to the reversal or Alpha counter."
00:49,000;01:02,820;"So it's done by tapping forward and Drive Impact, Heavy Punch and Heavy Kick when you're"
01:02,820;01:05,180;"in blockstun."
01:05,180;01:10,660;"So this, so the move ends."
01:10,660;01:18,420;"cancels the blockstun and then you do like a horizontal like lunging attack and"
01:18,420;01:33,220;"if the opponent gets hit then they're knocked they get pushed back pretty far"
01:33,220;01:49,780;"they're knocked down and they incur a Grey Life damage. So Grey Life damage is"
01:49,780;02:02,660;"recovers slowly after a few seconds. But if you get hit,"
02:02,660;02:05,560;"while you're..."
02:05,560;02:14,160;"if you get hit again, or if you get hit before the Grey Life recovers,"
02:14,160;02:16,660;"that damage becomes permanent."
02:16,660;02:22,160;"Uh..."
02:22,160;02:28,360;"I have to check and see if you can"
02:28,360;02:31,360;"throw them out of it."
02:31,860;02:38,340;"If you can throw them out of the driver versa on reaction, or the driver versa on reaction,"
02:38,340;02:43,140;"but I don't think you can because that was one of the major problems with the"
02:43,140;02:48,980;"reversal in Street Fighter V is that if you bated it out, you could just throw them."
02:48,980;02:51,380;"So there's that."
02:57,380;03:11,220;"The other thing is that if it's, you can, it also, oh, oh, the cost is two of your drive"
03:11,220;03:15,220;"gauge stocks."
03:15,220;03:40,220;"So you can't, you know, like, you can't use it like all the time."
03:40,220;04:01,940;"And it can be, yeah, like each character's Drive Reversal is different, is a little different"
04:01,940;04:14,860;"in terms of how much range it has. So you have to be conscious of that because like if"
04:14,860;04:25,580;"you throw it out when they're too far away then you whiff and I'm pretty sure if they"
04:25,580;04:32,580;"hit you it counts as a punish counter."
04:32,580;04:43,460;"And if they block the driver reversal, it's the, I think you're only like minus 2 or minus"
04:43,460;04:55,380;"3. So you're safe if they block it, but it's"
04:55,380;05:02,380;"Not your turn anymore, but you don't get your turn back."
05:02,380;05:13,380;"The other thing about"
05:13,380;05:38,420;"about a Drive Reversal is if it's parried, yeah, if the Drive Reversal is parried, the"
05:38,420;05:59,740;"Defender has enough time to punish, you know, you can go into a full combo if you parry"
05:59,740;06:11,420;"a Drive Reversal successfully. But I have to look at how many startup frames, but I want"
06:11,420;06:26,100;"to say it's pretty similar to Drive Impact. So it's theoretically something that you can"
06:26,100;06:46,940;"react to with a parry but you can't bait it out and throw them."
06:46,940;06:51,620;"You might be, I'm pretty sure if you're close to them and you do it and you bait it out,"
06:51,620;07:02,180;"I'm pretty sure you could also hold up and that would work too."
07:02,180;07:08,140;"So that's driver or sole two bars of Drive Gauge stock."
07:08,140;07:15,500;"So now, let's talk about the Drive Parry."
07:15,500;07:33,020;"So if you played third strike or street fighter five, you're probably familiar with the parry."
07:33,020;07:40,900;"It's done by pressing Medium Punch and Medium Kick together."
07:40,900;07:49,460;"So the same input as V-Skill in Street Fighter V."
07:49,460;08:02,180;"So if you played Ryu in Street Fighter V, then it basically works the same way as it"
08:02,180;08:11,260;"did in that game, which is much different than the way that it worked in Third Strike, which"
08:11,260;08:27,940;"is you would have to tap forward. So it costs half a bar to"
08:27,940;08:54,940;"attempt the parry. But if the parry is successful, then you get the half bar back."
08:54,940;09:13,900;"So, the way it works is you want to do the parry right as the move, as the attacker's"
09:13,900;09:19,740;"move is making contact."
09:19,740;09:37,620;"And so yeah, if it connects, like if the parry is successful, then you don't take any damage"
09:37,620;09:41,300;"from the attack like it absorbs the hit"
09:41,300;09:42,780;"and"
09:42,780;09:45,260;"depending on the move"
09:45,260;09:46,260;"you"
09:46,260;09:47,660;"may"
09:47,660;09:48,860;"be able"
09:48,860;09:50,060;"to"
09:50,060;09:53,220;"um... to counter attack"
09:53,220;09:55,740;"and"
09:55,740;09:59,300;"uh..."
09:59,300;10:00,900;"i believe"
10:00,900;10:03,260;"you get a"
10:03,260;10:05,660;"i believe it'll count as uh..."
10:05,660;10:12,660;"a punish counter"
10:12,660;10:17,820;"i'm not totally sure"
10:17,820;10:22,820;"like what the window is i have to check"
10:22,820;10:28,180;"uh... the uh... okay so the other thing about"
10:28,180;10:30,300;"the parry"
10:30,300;10:31,540;"makes it"
10:31,540;10:33,020;"much different"
10:33,020;10:45,620;"from previous iterations is that you can just hold the buttons down to parry multiple hits"
10:45,620;10:57,260;"as opposed to needing to tap it with each hit that you're trying to parry."
10:57,260;11:11,460;"So this makes parrying moves that hit multiple times super easy."
11:11,460;11:21,820;"The other thing is that even though it, I feel like the window is six frames."
11:21,820;11:25,700;"I think the window is six frames."
11:25,700;11:35,860;"just say the Windows 6 frames. So within that 6 frame window where you where the"
11:35,860;11:54,240;"attack will be parried if you if it connects in the first like it if you"
11:54,240;12:14,480;"parry in that six-frame window if the move makes contact in the first two frames of the"
12:14,480;12:26,480;"parry then you get a Perfect Parry and you'll know that you got the Perfect Parry because the"
12:26,480;12:32,720;"game slows down and there's this big animation effect"
12:36,720;12:44,720;"kind of like the animation from hitting a Drive Impact successfully."
12:44,720;12:51,360;"And"
12:58,160;13:07,200;"The Perfect Parry allows for a huge window of time to counter-attack."
13:07,200;13:15,760;"It's probably as much time as you get from hitting a Drive Impact."
13:19,840;13:33,480;"Whereas with a regular parry, for most moves,"
13:33,480;13:38,920;"you don't get enough frame advantage"
13:38,920;13:47,440;"from landing a successful parry in order to--"
13:47,440;13:51,440;"like you don't get enough frame advantage to counter attack."
13:51,440;14:02,840;"So,"
14:02,840;14:07,540;"you know,"
14:07,540;14:12,940;"that kind of,"
14:14,440;14:26,140;"And to me that makes it like regular parry kind of weak."
14:26,140;14:37,760;"Because in Third Strike, you know, you could..."
14:37,760;14:54,280;"Like, in third strike usually, um, in third strike if you got a parry, if you parried"
14:54,280;15:04,320;"like a medium or heavy attack, that was usually, um, that would usually give you enough time"
15:04,320;15:15,680;"to counterattack with like, you know, whatever your characters main, you know, combo starter was."
15:15,680;15:30,240;"And, you know, that basically, oh, and even on a light attack, if you parried a light up close,"
15:33,680;15:42,000;"you still had enough time to be able to throw the attacker."
15:42,000;16:02,880;"So, you know, what that resulted in was the parry being like a very high reward mechanic in Third Strike."
16:02,880;16:18,180;"It's Street Fighter V. You know, regular parry isn't, you know, isn't high reward, but"
16:18,180;16:23,800;"definitely the Perfect Parry is high reward."
16:23,800;16:37,960;"But it's also high risk because just like in Street Fighter V, the parry has both startup"
16:37,960;16:43,800;"frames and recovery frames."
16:43,800;16:52,360;"Whereas in Third Strike, there basically were no startup frames."
16:52,360;16:59,760;"So you could do a parry on wake up."
16:59,760;17:06,880;"And because you're just tapping forward,"
17:06,880;17:12,320;"if the opponent wasn't attacking,"
17:12,320;17:18,040;"then there was no recovery animation,"
17:18,040;17:21,040;"because you just tapped forward and nothing happened."
17:21,040;17:24,940;"But starting in Street Fighter V"
17:24,940;17:27,040;"and now coming into Street Fighter VI,"
17:27,040;17:33,040;"there are startup frames and recovery frames"
17:33,040;17:39,640;"on the parry, which means if the attacker"
17:39,640;18:00,880;"If an attacker is doing, if an attacker has, if an attacker is timing, if the opponent"
18:00,880;18:24,680;"is timing the attack, is timing a meaty attack to hit you right as you're getting up. The"
18:24,680;18:45,520;"meaty attack wins because the parry has a two frame startup. So that means that you can't"
18:45,520;19:02,300;"You can do the parry on wake up, but if the meaty attack connects on the first two frames"
19:02,300;19:26,540;"of the parry, the parry loses. So like, you know, like, that may not sound like, like,"
19:26,540;19:34,940;"I would say it's too early to tell whether or not Wake Up Parry is going to be something"
19:34,940;19:40,420;"that is a reliable option on Wake Up."
19:40,420;19:55,940;"But I don't think it will be because it's basically designed not to be an omniscient"
19:55,940;20:05,140;"or a um it's not supposed to be a strong wake-up option because in third strike it was arguably"
20:05,140;20:18,580;"too strong of a wake-up option and in that game you always had to worry about wake-up parry because"
20:24,980;20:30,100;"Because let's say if you were fighting a character like Juri with like"
20:30,100;20:34,660;"unblockables or like super high damage output, you know,"
20:34,660;20:40,980;"the, you know, the defender can have, you know,"
20:40,980;20:50,020;"you could be losing the entire round and then get one lucky wake-up parry"
20:50,500;20:59,940;"and then totally, um, you know, switch totally switch the momentum up and"
20:59,940;21:11,300;"you know, do a, you know, do like game changing damage, do like, yeah, do game changing damage"
21:11,300;21:16,820;"off of parrying one low light attack."
21:16,820;21:39,460;"You know, so I think they've basically toned down how good it is on wake up to prevent"
21:39,460;21:41,500;"those situations."
21:41,500;22:10,540;"The other thing about Perfect Parry is that you can't..."
22:10,540;22:24,620;"If you get a Perfect Parry, the damage scaling starts at 50%."
22:24,620;22:34,060;"So I don't know if that's like the entire combo is just 50% damage scaling or it starts"
22:34,060;22:38,340;"at 50% and goes lower with every hit that I don't know."
22:38,340;22:52,940;"I have to check, but it's significant that the damage is reduced."
22:52,940;23:15,340;"and also like even as a dirt strike player with years of parrying experience, I find"
23:15,340;23:41,020;"whoa I find perfect parries to be really is really difficult. It's also worth mentioning."
23:41,020;23:44,020;"I haven't tested this myself."
23:44,020;23:46,020;"Well, okay."
23:46,020;24:00,020;"It's worth noting that it appears like the Perfect Parry can't be done."
24:00,020;24:02,680;"Like, you have to..."
24:02,680;24:06,620;"The move has to make contact in those first..."
24:06,620;24:10,120;"Not only does the move have to make contact..."
24:10,120;24:12,220;"Or..."
24:12,220;24:14,720;"In those first two frames..."
24:14,720;24:16,120;"But like..."
24:16,120;24:22,820;"It appears like it doesn't benefit from the..."
24:26,520;24:41,160;"It doesn't benefit from the input buffering system like other inputs do."
24:41,160;24:47,640;"For example, in Street Fighter V,"
24:50,760;25:00,520;"Street Fighter V introduced either, I think it was a three-frame buffer, where you could,"
25:00,520;25:15,080;"you could do a move like up to three or five frames early, and the game would just"
25:17,720;25:34,680;"register it as coming out on the earliest possible frame, which made Link combos much,"
25:34,680;25:39,680;"much easier to the point, to the level of..."
25:39,680;25:51,680;"It basically makes it so that one frame links"
25:51,680;25:57,920;"aren't actually one frame because you had,"
25:57,920;26:03,880;"because you could input the next hit of the console,"
26:03,880;26:10,440;"the next hit of the combo up to three frames earlier or five frames and it would still"
26:10,440;26:21,000;"and the game would count it as having, you know, come out on the first possible frame."
26:21,000;26:35,240;"Whereas in Street Fighter IV, one-frame links really were one-frame links."
26:35,240;27:01,840;"though the planking technique was discovered which allowed which basically lets you generate"
27:01,840;27:08,840;"extra inputs to make those one-frame links easier to do."
27:08,840;27:18,680;"So what does it mean that the parry doesn't benefit from the..."
27:18,680;27:26,760;"What does it mean that you can't input buffer the Perfect Parry?"
27:26,760;27:40,500;"Well that means that it actually has to hit on, it actually has to hit in that two frame"
27:40,500;27:49,920;"window."
27:49,920;28:11,680;"Otherwise, you get a regular parry and most likely you won't be able to punish the move."
28:11,680;28:26,480;"So I'm pretty sure that means that because the parry has a two frame startup, you only"
28:26,480;28:36,640;"have, you can only get the Perfect Parry on frames three and four."
28:36,640;28:52,640;"And there's no input buffering, so you literally had a window of..."
28:52,640;29:00,640;"You have a one-thirtieth of a second window to hit the Perfect Parry."
29:00,640;29:05,140;"And so if you hit it too..."
29:05,140;29:15,620;"Yeah, like the the attackers move has to collide"
29:15,620;29:23,260;"with the parry on frames three or four in order to get the Perfect Parry. If it's"
29:23,260;29:29,060;"the four frame three the parry loses because it's"
29:29,980;29:32,340;"still in the startup frames and"
29:32,340;29:35,740;"if it's"
29:35,740;29:43,020;"And if it's after and if it's the fourth"
29:43,020;29:48,180;"If it's the fourth"
29:48,180;29:52,900;"Sorry if it's the"
29:52,900;29:55,780;"Fifth"
29:55,780;30:03,720;"Okay, yeah, if it hits on..."
30:03,720;30:07,660;"Okay, let's start over."
30:07,660;30:19,900;"If it hits, if the attack makes contact on frames one or two, the parry loses."
30:19,900;30:32,900;"On frames 3 and 4 you get a Perfect Parry and then on frames 5 through 8 you get a regular"
30:32,900;30:41,780;"parry and likely won't be able to counter attack with anything."
30:41,780;31:04,020;"But after frame 8, you're in recovery frames, which means that if the opponent hits you,"
31:04,020;31:13,820;"score a... they'll get the punish counter frame and damage bonus."
31:13,820;31:18,820;"So, um..."
31:18,820;31:26,820;"Yeah, I mean..."
31:29,020;31:45,020;"I don't know. Me personally, I guess I haven't trained parries enough to feel like I'm a threat with them."
31:45,020;31:55,020;"Because it just seems so daunting to..."
31:55,020;32:05,020;"It's like the risk reward is not..."
32:05,020;32:13,020;"Like the risk is really high and the reward is pretty low."
32:13,020;32:18,300;"low even if you get the Perfect Parry there's still the 50% damage scaling."
32:18,300;32:34,940;"But one way that it is that it does seem to be one situation that it does seem to be"
32:35,500;32:46,700;"like pretty effective in is in a cross-up situation on wake-up. So if the opponent is trying to"
32:46,700;32:51,260;"if you're knocked down and the opponent goes for the cross-up,"
32:51,260;33:01,740;"going for the parry is probably a pretty good option because"
33:04,780;33:06,780;"Like, it doesn't..."
33:06,780;33:08,780;"Like, the parry will..."
33:08,780;33:11,780;"The parry will auto-correct."
33:11,780;33:15,780;"So you don't need to..."
33:15,780;33:22,780;"You don't need to worry about blocking the opposite way."
33:22,780;33:27,780;"And if you get the Perfect Parry..."
33:27,780;33:30,780;"Then..."
33:32,780;33:41,420;"Yeah, you have enough time to counter attack."
33:41,420;33:50,860;"The other thing to note is that you cannot parry when you're in burnout mode because"
33:50,860;33:55,940;"you have no bar."
33:55,940;34:08,060;"Yeah, can't parry when you're in burnout."
34:08,060;34:27,860;"Oh, and I guess it's also worth mentioning that you don't..."
34:27,860;34:37,340;"If you parry a special move, you don't take any chip damage."
34:37,340;34:51,500;"parry a normal it doesn't decrease your Drive Gauge so that's parries"
