# Effective Training in Street Fighter 6

Training effectively in Street Fighter 6 is not that much different from training in any other aspect of life. It comes down to having a plan, working at it consistently, playing matches, getting feedback on your game, reviewing your matches, working on the problems in your game, and repeating the process.

## Setting Goals

When it comes to having a plan, first, you need to have a goal. Your goal can be as big or as little as you want. The most important aspects of setting your goals are that they are measurable, actionable, and have a timeline. It doesn't matter whether your goal is to win Evo, be the best with your character, make it up to silver rank online, or simply beat a friend or family member you're tired of losing to in person. What matters is that you set goals that you can measure objectively to know whether or not you've achieved them.

### Ineffective Goal Example

An ineffective goal is, *"I want to get good at Street Fighter 6."* This goal is not specific enough. If you just want to be a little bit better and learn a new combo with your character, congratulations, you're "good" now.

### Effective Goal Example

To make the goal measurable, you can look at your current win rate over a period of time and record that, then try to improve. If your last 20 matches show a 25% win rate, set a goal like, *"I'm going to increase my win rate from 25% to 30%."* This way, you can check back in another 20 games to see if you've reached your goal.

It's also important to set a timeline for this goal, as it will create urgency. You may not have just one goal; perhaps you set several goals. 

Some goals can be related to outcome, such as improving your win rate, while others might be related to committing to the process of improving, like spending five minutes a day in training mode working on your execution four days a week.

### A Different Method for Setting Goals: The MTO Technique

Sometimes setting goals can be difficult, particularly when they are binary and don't account for different levels of achievement. It can be tough to deal with not reaching your goals and convincing yourself that these goals are possible if you haven't already achieved a certain level. One technique to address this issue is the MTO technique, developed by Raymond Aaron. With this technique, you break your goals down into three levels:

1.  **Minimum**: The level you're confident you can achieve.
2.  **Target**: The level you think you could probably achieve.
3.  **Outrageous**: The level that you don't currently think is even possible.

This approach sets you up in such a way that it's almost a sure thing that you can hit the minimum, but you still have a higher level that is above where you're at, and it positions a super high level as both within and outside the realm of possibility.

In the early days of Street Fighter IV, I used this method. I wrote it down on physical paper and looked at it all the time. Although I didn't hit all the goals, I did achieve a lot more than I thought was possible and reached the outrageous level in a couple of them.

## Defeating Your Arch-Rival
So now that we have our goals positioned, what do we do to start working towards them?

Continuing with our goal of defeating our arch-rival, Johnny Donuts, in a first-to-five in the next six months, how are we going to do this?

Oftentimes, the reason why we're losing to our arch-rivals typically comes down to a handful of key factors.

### Subpar execution.
You can't hit the right combos when it counts because either you choke under pressure, or you haven't built the muscle memory to do the combo, even in training mode, or maybe you're not doing the most amount of damage in different opportunities.

### Character unfamiliarity.
Maybe Johnny Donuts plays a character that you hate, or you think is cheap, or you're unfamiliar with. They must be playing a character that we are unfamiliar with or they play a character archetype that you find annoying, or they're playing a character that you consider overpowered or a bad matchup for your character.

### Predictability.

Another reason why your arch-rival is difficult to beat is because they always seem to know what you're going to do before you do.

### Execution

This one is the most straightforward because, aside from the hardware configuration of your setup, your execution is the only other component of your game that you are in full control of. It doesn't matter what character you're playing, what you think the tier list is, or even what character your arch-rival happens to play. Your execution is 100% your responsibility and in your control fully at all times.

Therefore, because it's completely your control, it is also your responsibility to make sure that your execution is up to snuff. That you're able to do the moves and combos that you want to be doing in the heat of battle every single time.

So how do you get it to the level where you can hit your moves and combos in real matches every time? 

Well, it starts in training mode. Personally, I strive to be able to hit my combos 10 times in a row on both sides and I will practice them until I can do that.

The next step would be setting the dummy in Training Mode to the CPU at a low level, so that they're moving and trying to attack you, but not going too hard, and then being able to hit that combo against the moving dummy.

### Maximizing Damage
Once you've improved your execution, the next level is maximizing the damage that you can inflict with every opportunity. Newer players, even if they can do basic combos with their character, might not be doing the most amount of damage that they can get from any given situation with their character, usually due to a lack of game knowledge or character knowledge.

Make sure you're at least getting in the ballpark of the maximum amount of damage that your character can do in any given situation. Learn combos for situations with no meter, one or two meters of drive gauge, and different levels of super.

### Understanding Your Arch-Rival's Character

Once you've improved your execution and overall damage output per situation, the next step is to work on your knowledge of Johnny Donuts' character. You don't have to be an expert, but you do need to be competent. Spend time learning their character, even if you don't like their playstyle.

### Analyzing Replays

Analyzing replays is a critical part of improving your gameplay. It allows you to review and identify your own mistakes and patterns, as well as observe your arch-rival's tendencies. By understanding where you went wrong and what your opponent is doing, you can make adjustments and improve your chances of winning in future matches.

Here are some steps to analyze your replays effectively:

```
```ad-tip
Before your replay starts, pause the game and turn on Input Display and Frame Advantage so you can see both players' inputs and how the frame advantage of each move in real-time. 
```

1.  **Watch the replays from a neutral perspective:** Try to detach yourself emotionally from the match and view it as if you were watching two other players. This will help you be more objective in your analysis.
    
2.  **Identify patterns and habits:** Pay attention to both your own habits and your opponent's. Are you always doing the same move after a specific situation? Does your opponent have a predictable playstyle or particular moves they favor? Make a note of these patterns so you can exploit them or break your own habits.
    
3.  **Take note of successful and unsuccessful decisions:** Keep track of the decisions you made during the match that led to success or failure. Were there times when you made a good read or correctly punished your opponent? What about instances where you made a poor decision that cost you the round? By identifying these moments, you can learn from your mistakes and reinforce good habits.
    
4.  **Look for opportunities you may have missed:** Sometimes, in the heat of a match, you may overlook certain opportunities to deal more damage or gain an advantage. Reviewing the replays can help you spot these missed chances, and you can practice capitalizing on them in future games.
    
5.  **Compare your gameplay to high-level players:** If possible, watch replays of top players who use your character or face your arch-rival's character. Observe their decision-making, combos, and strategies, and see if you can implement any of their techniques into your own gameplay.
    
6.  **Create a plan of action:** Based on your analysis, develop a plan for improving your gameplay. This may include practicing specific combos or setups, breaking bad habits, or focusing on specific matchup knowledge. Set concrete goals to work on before your next match against Johnny Donuts.
    

By consistently analyzing your replays and making necessary adjustments, you'll be better prepared to face your arch-rival and eventually defeat them in a first-to-five match. Remember, improvement is a gradual process, so stay patient and persistent in your efforts.

#### Applying the MTO Technique

Let's apply this method to the goal of beating your arch-rival in Street Fighter 6:

-   **Minimum**: I will beat Johnny Donuts one game by the end of the year.
-   **Target**: I will beat Johnny Donuts in a first-to-five set by the end of the year.
-   **Outrageous**: I will beat Johnny Donuts in a first-to-five set by September 30th.

The minimum goal is achievable and realistic, given six months of training. The target goal is more challenging but still within the realm of possibility. The outrageous level is supposed to be the most challenging and may seem impossible, but that's okay because you still have the minimum and target levels that your mind believes are possible.

By setting goals in this way, you give yourself a range of possibilities and levels to work towards, making it more likely that you'll find motivation and success in your training.

As you achieve your goals, you will gain confidence and momentum to set new goals and consistently reach higher and higher levels of performance.
